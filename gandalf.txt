['[Gandalf:]"What do you mean? Do you mean to\nwish me a good morning, or do you\nmean that it is a good morning\nwhether I want it or not? Or,\nperhaps you mean to say that you\nfeel good on this particular\nmorning, or are you simply stating\nthat this is a morning to be good\non?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"That remains to be seen. I\'m\nlooking for someone to share in an\nadventure."', '[Gandalf:]\n"To think that I should have lived\nto be good-morninged by Belladonna\nTook\'s son as if I were selling\nbuttons at the door."', '[Gandalf:]\n"You\'ve changed, and not entirely\nfor the better, Bilbo Baggins."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Well, you know my name, although\nyou don\'t remember I belong to it.\n"I\'m Gandalf and Gandalf means me!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"And where else should I be?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Well, I\'m pleased to find you\nremember something about me, even\nif it\'s only my fireworks. Well\nthen, that\'s decided. It will be\nvery good for you and most amusing\nfor me. I shall inform the others."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Oh, no thank you, Balin. A little\nred wine for me, I think."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Fili, Kili, Oin, Gloin, Balin and\nDwalin. We appear to be one dwarf\nshort."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Cheers!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"My dear Bilbo, what on earth is the\nmatter?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"They\'re quite a merry gathering,\nonce you get used to them."', '[Gandalf:]\n"He is here."', '[Gandalf:]\n"There is a mark; I put it there\nmyself. Bilbo Baggins, allow me to\nintroduce the leader of our\ncompany, Thorin Oakenshield."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Bilbo, my dear fellow, let us have\na little more light."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Well, no, I wouldn\'t say that I -"', '[Gandalf:]\n"What?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"That, my dear Balin, is not\nentirely true."', '[Gandalf:]\n"It was given to me by your father,\nby Thrain, for safe keeping. It is\nyours now."', '[Gandalf:]\n"These ruins speak of another\npassage into the lower halls."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Well, if we can find it, but dwarf\ndoors are invisible when closed.\nThe answer lies hidden somewhere in\nthis map and I do not have the\nskill to find it. But there are\nothers in Middle Earth who can."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Hobbits are remarkably light on\ntheir feet! In fact, they can go\nunseen by most if they choose. And\nwhile the dragon is accustomed to\nthe smell of dwarf, the scent of a\nhobbit is all but unknown to him\nwhich gives us a distinct\nadvantage."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Very helpful, Fili."', '[Gandalf:]\n"You\'ve been sitting quietly for far\ntoo long. When did doliles and your\nmother\'s dishes become so important\nto you? I remember a young hobbit\nwho was always running off in\nsearch of elves in the woods. He\'d\nstay out late, trailing mud and\ntwigs and fireflies. A young hobbit\nwho would have liked nothing better\nthan to find out what was beyond\nthe borders of the Shire...\nThe world is not in your books and\nmaps. It\'s out there."', '[Gandalf:]\n"You are also a Took! Did you know\nthat your great-great-great-great\nuncle, Bullroarer Took was so large\nhe could ride a real horse?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Well, he could! In the Battle of\nGreen Fields, he charged the goblin\nranks. He swung his club so hard,\nit knocked the Goblin King\'s head\nclean off, and it sailed a hundred\nyards through the air and went down\na rabbit hole. And thus the battle\nwas won, and the game of golf\ninvented at the same time."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Well, all good stories deserve\nembellishment. You\'ll have a tale\nor two to tell of your own when you\ncome back."', '[Gandalf:]\n"No. But if you do, you will not be\nthe same."', '[Gandalf:]\n"My dear Bilbo, what on earth is the\nmatter?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"It is raining, Master Dwarf, and it\nwill continue to rain until the\nrain is done. If you wish to change\nthe weather of the world, you\nshould find yourself another\nwizard."', '[Gandalf:]\n"What?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"There are five of us. The greatest\nof our order is Saruman the White.\nThen there are the two blue\nwizards...\nYou know, I\'ve quite forgotten\ntheir names."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Well, that would be Radagast the\nBrown."', '[Gandalf:]\n"I think he is a very great wizard\nin his own way. He\'s a gently soul\nwho prefers the company of animals\nto others."', '[Gandalf:]\n"A farmer and his family used to\nlive here."', '[Gandalf:]\n"I think it would be wiser to move\non. We could make for the Hidden\nValley."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Why not? The elves could help us!\nWe could get food, rest, advice."', '[Gandalf:]\n"We have a map we cannot read; Lord\nElrond will help us."', '[Gandalf:]\n"You are neither of them. And\nbesides, it was not Lord Elrond who\nabandoned you at Erebor. That blame\nlies with King Thranduil of the\nWoodland Realm. I did not give you\nthat map and key for you to hold\nonto the past."', '[Gandalf:]\n"To seek the company of the only one\naround here who\'s got any sense."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Myself, Mr. Baggins! I\'ve had\nenough of dwarves for one day."', '[Gandalf:]\n"The dawn will take you all!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"To look ahead."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Looking behind. Nasty business;\nstill, they\'re all in one piece."', '[Gandalf:]\n"He had the nous to play for time.\nNone of the rest of you thought of\nthat."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Oh, not for an age. Not since a\ndarker power ruled these lands. In\nany case, they could not have moved\nin daylight."', '[Gandalf:]\n"It\'s a troll hoard. Be careful what\nyou touch."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Nor were they made by any smith\namong men."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Bilbo, here. This is about your\nsize."', '[Gandalf:]\n"The blade is of Elvish make, which\nmeans it will glow blue when orcs\nor goblins are nearby."', '[Gandalf:]\n"And I hope you\'ll never have to.\nBut if you do, remember this: true\ncourage is about knowing not when\nto take a life, but when to spare\none."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Stay together! Hurry now, arm\nyourselves."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Radagast! It\'s Radagast the Brown."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Webs? What do you mean?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Dol Guldur? But the old fortress is\nabandoned."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Now, a Necromancer? Are you sure?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Who did you tell about your quest,\nbeyond your kin."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Who did you tell?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"You are being hunted!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"These are Gundabad Wargs, they will\noutrun you!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Come on."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Move. Run!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"This way, you fools!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"I think that would be wise."', '[Gandalf:]\n"You can feel it?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"That\'s exactly what it is. A very\npowerful magic."', '[Gandalf:]\n"The Valley of Imraldis. In the\nCommon Tongue, it\'s known by\nanother name."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Here lies the last homely house\neast of the sea."', '[Gandalf:]\n"You have no enemies here, Thorin\nOakenshield. The only ill-will to\nbe found in this valley is that\nwhich you bring yourself."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Of course they will. But we have\nquestions that need to be answered.\nIf we are to be successful, this\nwill need to be handled with tact\nand respect and no small degree of\ncharm, which is why you will leave\nthe talking to me."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Ah, Lindir!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"I must speak with Lord Elrond."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Not here? Where is he?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Lord Elrond.\nMy friend! Where have you been."', '[Gandalf:]\n"That may have been us."', '[Gandalf:]\n"No, master Gloin, he\'s offering you\nfood."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Kind of you to invite us. I\'m not\nreally dressed for dinner."', '[Gandalf:]\n"We found them in a troll hoard on\nthe Great East Road, shorty before\nwe were ambushed by orcs."', '[Gandalf:]\n"For goodness sake, Thorin, show him\nthe map."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Save me from the stubbornness of\ndwarves. Your pride will be your\ndownfall. You stand here in the\npresence of one of the few in\nMiddle Earth who can read that map.\nShow it to Lord Elrond!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"It\'s mainly academic. As you know,\nthis sort of artifact sometimes\ncontains hidden text. You still\nread ancient dwarvish, do you not?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Moon runes? Of course; an easy\nthing to miss."', '[Gandalf:]\n"It is the start of the dwarves\'\nnear year, when the last moon of\nautumn and the first sun of winter\nappear in the sky together."', '[Gandalf:]\n"What do you mean?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Of course I was going to tell you,\nI was waiting for this very chance.\nAnd really, I think you can trust\nthat I know what I am doing."', '[Gandalf:]\n"What if we succeed? If the dwarves\ntake back the mountain, our\ndefenses in the east will be\nstrengthened."', '[Gandalf:]\n"It is also dangerous to do nothing.\nThe throne of Erebor is Thorin\'s\nbirthright, what is it you fear?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"With or without our help, these\ndwarves will march on the mountain.\nThey are determined to reclaim\ntheir homeland. I do not believe\nThorin Oakenshield feels that he\'s\nanswerable to anyone. Nor for that\nmatter am I."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Lady Galadriel."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Age may have changed me, but not so\nthe Lady of Lorien."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Saruman."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Unnoticed? No, I\'m simply doing\nwhat I feel to be right."', '[Gandalf:]\n"It is true, my lady. Smaug owes\nallegiance to no one. But if he\nshould side with the enemy, a\ndragon could be used to terrible\neffect."', '[Gandalf:]\n"There is something at work beyond\nthe evil of Smaug. Something far\nmore powerful. We can remain blind\nto it, but it will not be ignoring\nus, that I can promise you. A\nsickness lies over the Greenwood.\nThe woodsmen who live there now\ncall it Mirkwood, and they say..."', '[Gandalf:]\n"They speak of a Necromancer living\nin Dol Guldur, a sorcerer who can\nsummon the dead."', '[Gandalf:]\n"And so I thought too, but Radagast\nhas seen -"', '[Gandalf:]\n"I have none."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Yes."', '[Gandalf:]\n"I do not know. Saruman believes\nthat it is only great power that\ncan hold evil in check. But that is\nnot what I have found. I\'ve found\nthat it is the small things,\neveryday deeds of ordinary folk\nthat keeps the darkness at bay.\nSimple acts of kindess and love.\nWhy Bilbo Baggins? Perhaps it is\nbecause I\'m afraid and he gives me\ncourage."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Take up arms. Fight. Fight!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Follow me! Quick! Run!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Three, four, five, Gloin, that\'s\nsix. And Dwalin, that makes seven."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Well, where did you last see him?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"What happened exactly? Tell me!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Bilbo Baggins! I\'ve never been so\nglad to see anyone in my life!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Well, what does it matter? He\'s\nback."', '[Gandalf:]\n"And into the fire. Run. Run!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Come on!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"This way, quickly!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"To the house! Run!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Come on, get inside!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"That is our host. His name is Beorn\nand he\'s a skinchanger. Sometimes\nhe\'s a huge, black bear, sometimes\nhe\'s a great, strong man. The bear\nis unpredictable, but the man can\nbe reasoned with. However, he is\nnot overfond of dwarves."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Don\'t be ridiculous. He\'s under no\nenchantment but his own.\nAlright now, get some rest, all of\nyou. You\'ll be safe here tonight."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Before Durin\'s Day falls, yes."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Which is why we must go through\nMirkwood."', '[Gandalf:]\n"We will take the Elven Road. That\npath is still safe."', '[Gandalf:]\n"You have my word."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Why now? What has made Bolg crawl\nfrom his hole?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Are you sure of this?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"What do you know of this sorcerer,\nthe one they call the Necromancer?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"The dead?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Yes. Yes, there are tombs up there."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Saruman the White says it is not\npossible. The enemy is destroyed\nand will never return."', '[Gandalf:]\n"The Elven Gate."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Set the ponies loose. Let them\nreturn to their master."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Not if we go two hundred miles\nnorth, or twice that distance\nsouth."', '[Gandalf:]\n"The High Fells. So be it."', '[Gandalf:]\n"I would not do this unless I had\nto."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Found what?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Good. Well, that\'s good; you\'ll\nneed it."', '[Gandalf:]\n"You must stay on the path; do not\nleave it. If you do, you will never\nfind it again."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Oh, it\'s you!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Trust me, Radagast, I would not\nhave called you here without good\nreason."', '[Gandalf:]\n"No, it is not."', '[Gandalf:]\n"If he had a name, it\'s long since\nbeen lost. He would have only been\nknown as a servant of evil. One of\na number. One of nine."', '[Gandalf:]\n"The Ringwraiths have been summouned\nto Dol Guldur."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Who said it was human?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"To rejoin the others!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"I started this; I cannot forsake\nthem. They are all in grave danger."', '[Gandalf:]\n"You want me to cast my friends\naside?"']
