[Gandalf:]"What do you mean? Do you mean to
wish me a good morning, or do you
mean that it is a good morning
whether I want it or not? Or,
perhaps you mean to say that you
feel good on this particular
morning, or are you simply stating
that this is a morning to be good
on?"
[Gandalf:]
"That remains to be seen. I'm
looking for someone to share in an
adventure."
[Gandalf:]
"To think that I should have lived
to be good-morninged by Belladonna
Took's son as if I were selling
buttons at the door."
[Gandalf:]
"You've changed, and not entirely
for the better, Bilbo Baggins."
[Gandalf:]
"Well, you know my name, although
you don't remember I belong to it.
"I'm Gandalf and Gandalf means me!"
[Gandalf:]
"And where else should I be?"
[Gandalf:]
"Well, I'm pleased to find you
remember something about me, even
if it's only my fireworks. Well
then, that's decided. It will be
very good for you and most amusing
for me. I shall inform the others."
[Gandalf:]
"Oh, no thank you, Balin. A little
red wine for me, I think."
[Gandalf:]
"Fili, Kili, Oin, Gloin, Balin and
Dwalin. We appear to be one dwarf
short."
[Gandalf:]
"Cheers!"
[Gandalf:]
"My dear Bilbo, what on earth is the
matter?"
[Gandalf:]
"They're quite a merry gathering,
once you get used to them."
[Gandalf:]
"He is here."
[Gandalf:]
"There is a mark; I put it there
myself. Bilbo Baggins, allow me to
introduce the leader of our
company, Thorin Oakenshield."
[Gandalf:]
"Bilbo, my dear fellow, let us have
a little more light."
[Gandalf:]
"Well, no, I wouldn't say that I -"
[Gandalf:]
"What?"
[Gandalf:]
"That, my dear Balin, is not
entirely true."
[Gandalf:]
"It was given to me by your father,
by Thrain, for safe keeping. It is
yours now."
[Gandalf:]
"These ruins speak of another
passage into the lower halls."
[Gandalf:]
"Well, if we can find it, but dwarf
doors are invisible when closed.
The answer lies hidden somewhere in
this map and I do not have the
skill to find it. But there are
others in Middle Earth who can."
[Gandalf:]
"Hobbits are remarkably light on
their feet! In fact, they can go
unseen by most if they choose. And
while the dragon is accustomed to
the smell of dwarf, the scent of a
hobbit is all but unknown to him
which gives us a distinct
advantage."
[Gandalf:]
"Very helpful, Fili."
[Gandalf:]
"You've been sitting quietly for far
too long. When did doliles and your
mother's dishes become so important
to you? I remember a young hobbit
who was always running off in
search of elves in the woods. He'd
stay out late, trailing mud and
twigs and fireflies. A young hobbit
who would have liked nothing better
than to find out what was beyond
the borders of the Shire...
The world is not in your books and
maps. It's out there."
[Gandalf:]
"You are also a Took! Did you know
that your great-great-great-great
uncle, Bullroarer Took was so large
he could ride a real horse?"
[Gandalf:]
"Well, he could! In the Battle of
Green Fields, he charged the goblin
ranks. He swung his club so hard,
it knocked the Goblin King's head
clean off, and it sailed a hundred
yards through the air and went down
a rabbit hole. And thus the battle
was won, and the game of golf
invented at the same time."
[Gandalf:]
"Well, all good stories deserve
embellishment. You'll have a tale
or two to tell of your own when you
come back."
[Gandalf:]
"No. But if you do, you will not be
the same."
[Gandalf:]
"My dear Bilbo, what on earth is the
matter?"
[Gandalf:]
"It is raining, Master Dwarf, and it
will continue to rain until the
rain is done. If you wish to change
the weather of the world, you
should find yourself another
wizard."
[Gandalf:]
"What?"
[Gandalf:]
"There are five of us. The greatest
of our order is Saruman the White.
Then there are the two blue
wizards...
You know, I've quite forgotten
their names."
[Gandalf:]
"Well, that would be Radagast the
Brown."
[Gandalf:]
"I think he is a very great wizard
in his own way. He's a gently soul
who prefers the company of animals
to others."
[Gandalf:]
"A farmer and his family used to
live here."
[Gandalf:]
"I think it would be wiser to move
on. We could make for the Hidden
Valley."
[Gandalf:]
"Why not? The elves could help us!
We could get food, rest, advice."
[Gandalf:]
"We have a map we cannot read; Lord
Elrond will help us."
[Gandalf:]
"You are neither of them. And
besides, it was not Lord Elrond who
abandoned you at Erebor. That blame
lies with King Thranduil of the
Woodland Realm. I did not give you
that map and key for you to hold
onto the past."
[Gandalf:]
"To seek the company of the only one
around here who's got any sense."
[Gandalf:]
"Myself, Mr. Baggins! I've had
enough of dwarves for one day."
[Gandalf:]
"The dawn will take you all!"
[Gandalf:]
"To look ahead."
[Gandalf:]
"Looking behind. Nasty business;
still, they're all in one piece."
[Gandalf:]
"He had the nous to play for time.
None of the rest of you thought of
that."
[Gandalf:]
"Oh, not for an age. Not since a
darker power ruled these lands. In
any case, they could not have moved
in daylight."
[Gandalf:]
"It's a troll hoard. Be careful what
you touch."
[Gandalf:]
"Nor were they made by any smith
among men."
[Gandalf:]
"Bilbo, here. This is about your
size."
[Gandalf:]
"The blade is of Elvish make, which
means it will glow blue when orcs
or goblins are nearby."
[Gandalf:]
"And I hope you'll never have to.
But if you do, remember this: true
courage is about knowing not when
to take a life, but when to spare
one."
[Gandalf:]
"Stay together! Hurry now, arm
yourselves."
[Gandalf:]
"Radagast! It's Radagast the Brown."
[Gandalf:]
"Webs? What do you mean?"
[Gandalf:]
"Dol Guldur? But the old fortress is
abandoned."
[Gandalf:]
"Now, a Necromancer? Are you sure?"
[Gandalf:]
"Who did you tell about your quest,
beyond your kin."
[Gandalf:]
"Who did you tell?"
[Gandalf:]
"You are being hunted!"
[Gandalf:]
"These are Gundabad Wargs, they will
outrun you!"
[Gandalf:]
"Come on."
[Gandalf:]
"Move. Run!"
[Gandalf:]
"This way, you fools!"
[Gandalf:]
"I think that would be wise."
[Gandalf:]
"You can feel it?"
[Gandalf:]
"That's exactly what it is. A very
powerful magic."
[Gandalf:]
"The Valley of Imraldis. In the
Common Tongue, it's known by
another name."
[Gandalf:]
"Here lies the last homely house
east of the sea."
[Gandalf:]
"You have no enemies here, Thorin
Oakenshield. The only ill-will to
be found in this valley is that
which you bring yourself."
[Gandalf:]
"Of course they will. But we have
questions that need to be answered.
If we are to be successful, this
will need to be handled with tact
and respect and no small degree of
charm, which is why you will leave
the talking to me."
[Gandalf:]
"Ah, Lindir!"
[Gandalf:]
"I must speak with Lord Elrond."
[Gandalf:]
"Not here? Where is he?"
[Gandalf:]
"Lord Elrond.
My friend! Where have you been."
[Gandalf:]
"That may have been us."
[Gandalf:]
"No, master Gloin, he's offering you
food."
[Gandalf:]
"Kind of you to invite us. I'm not
really dressed for dinner."
[Gandalf:]
"We found them in a troll hoard on
the Great East Road, shorty before
we were ambushed by orcs."
[Gandalf:]
"For goodness sake, Thorin, show him
the map."
[Gandalf:]
"Save me from the stubbornness of
dwarves. Your pride will be your
downfall. You stand here in the
presence of one of the few in
Middle Earth who can read that map.
Show it to Lord Elrond!"
[Gandalf:]
"It's mainly academic. As you know,
this sort of artifact sometimes
contains hidden text. You still
read ancient dwarvish, do you not?"
[Gandalf:]
"Moon runes? Of course; an easy
thing to miss."
[Gandalf:]
"It is the start of the dwarves'
near year, when the last moon of
autumn and the first sun of winter
appear in the sky together."
[Gandalf:]
"What do you mean?"
[Gandalf:]
"Of course I was going to tell you,
I was waiting for this very chance.
And really, I think you can trust
that I know what I am doing."
[Gandalf:]
"What if we succeed? If the dwarves
take back the mountain, our
defenses in the east will be
strengthened."
[Gandalf:]
"It is also dangerous to do nothing.
The throne of Erebor is Thorin's
birthright, what is it you fear?"
[Gandalf:]
"With or without our help, these
dwarves will march on the mountain.
They are determined to reclaim
their homeland. I do not believe
Thorin Oakenshield feels that he's
answerable to anyone. Nor for that
matter am I."
[Gandalf:]
"Lady Galadriel."
[Gandalf:]
"Age may have changed me, but not so
the Lady of Lorien."
[Gandalf:]
"Saruman."
[Gandalf:]
"Unnoticed? No, I'm simply doing
what I feel to be right."
[Gandalf:]
"It is true, my lady. Smaug owes
allegiance to no one. But if he
should side with the enemy, a
dragon could be used to terrible
effect."
[Gandalf:]
"There is something at work beyond
the evil of Smaug. Something far
more powerful. We can remain blind
to it, but it will not be ignoring
us, that I can promise you. A
sickness lies over the Greenwood.
The woodsmen who live there now
call it Mirkwood, and they say..."
[Gandalf:]
"They speak of a Necromancer living
in Dol Guldur, a sorcerer who can
summon the dead."
[Gandalf:]
"And so I thought too, but Radagast
has seen -"
[Gandalf:]
"I have none."
[Gandalf:]
"Yes."
[Gandalf:]
"I do not know. Saruman believes
that it is only great power that
can hold evil in check. But that is
not what I have found. I've found
that it is the small things,
everyday deeds of ordinary folk
that keeps the darkness at bay.
Simple acts of kindess and love.
Why Bilbo Baggins? Perhaps it is
because I'm afraid and he gives me
courage."
[Gandalf:]
"Take up arms. Fight. Fight!"
[Gandalf:]
"Follow me! Quick! Run!"
[Gandalf:]
"Three, four, five, Gloin, that's
six. And Dwalin, that makes seven."
[Gandalf:]
"Well, where did you last see him?"
[Gandalf:]
"What happened exactly? Tell me!"
[Gandalf:]
"Bilbo Baggins! I've never been so
glad to see anyone in my life!"
[Gandalf:]
"Well, what does it matter? He's
back."
[Gandalf:]
"And into the fire. Run. Run!"
[Gandalf:]
"Come on!"
[Gandalf:]
"This way, quickly!"
[Gandalf:]
"To the house! Run!"
[Gandalf:]
"Come on, get inside!"
[Gandalf:]
"That is our host. His name is Beorn
and he's a skinchanger. Sometimes
he's a huge, black bear, sometimes
he's a great, strong man. The bear
is unpredictable, but the man can
be reasoned with. However, he is
not overfond of dwarves."
[Gandalf:]
"Don't be ridiculous. He's under no
enchantment but his own.
Alright now, get some rest, all of
you. You'll be safe here tonight."
[Gandalf:]
"Before Durin's Day falls, yes."
[Gandalf:]
"Which is why we must go through
Mirkwood."
[Gandalf:]
"We will take the Elven Road. That
path is still safe."
[Gandalf:]
"You have my word."
[Gandalf:]
"Why now? What has made Bolg crawl
from his hole?"
[Gandalf:]
"Are you sure of this?"
[Gandalf:]
"What do you know of this sorcerer,
the one they call the Necromancer?"
[Gandalf:]
"The dead?"
[Gandalf:]
"Yes. Yes, there are tombs up there."
[Gandalf:]
"Saruman the White says it is not
possible. The enemy is destroyed
and will never return."
[Gandalf:]
"The Elven Gate."
[Gandalf:]
"Set the ponies loose. Let them
return to their master."
[Gandalf:]
"Not if we go two hundred miles
north, or twice that distance
south."
[Gandalf:]
"The High Fells. So be it."
[Gandalf:]
"I would not do this unless I had
to."
[Gandalf:]
"Found what?"
[Gandalf:]
"Good. Well, that's good; you'll
need it."
[Gandalf:]
"You must stay on the path; do not
leave it. If you do, you will never
find it again."
[Gandalf:]
"Oh, it's you!"
[Gandalf:]
"Trust me, Radagast, I would not
have called you here without good
reason."
[Gandalf:]
"No, it is not."
[Gandalf:]
"If he had a name, it's long since
been lost. He would have only been
known as a servant of evil. One of
a number. One of nine."
[Gandalf:]
"The Ringwraiths have been summouned
to Dol Guldur."
[Gandalf:]
"Who said it was human?"
[Gandalf:]
"To rejoin the others!"
[Gandalf:]
"I started this; I cannot forsake
them. They are all in grave danger."
[Gandalf:]
"You want me to cast my friends
aside?"
[Gandalf:] "Mind if I join you?"
[Gandalf:] "I’ll have the same."
[Gandalf:] "I should introduce myself. My name is Gandalf. Gandalf the Grey."
[Gandalf:] "Well now! This is a fine chance. What brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?"
[Gandalf:] "Thorin, it’s been a long time since anything but rumor was heard of Thrain."
[Gandalf:] "I urged him to march upon Erebor; to rally the seven armies of the dwarves, to destroy the dragon and take back the Lonely Mountain. And I would say the same to you. Take back your homeland."
[Gandalf:] "No, it is not. The Lonely Mountain troubles me, Thorin. That dragon has sat there long enough. Sooner or later, darker minds will turn toward Erebor. I ran into some unsavory characters whilst traveling along the Greenway. They mistook me for a vagabond."
[Gandalf:] "One of them was carrying a message."
[Gandalf:] "It is Black Speech."
[Gandalf:] "Promise of payment."
[Gandalf:] "Your head. Someone wants you dead. Thorin, you can wait no longer. You are the heir to the throne of Durin. Unite the armies of the dwarves. Together you have the might and power to retake Erebor. Summon a meeting of the seven dwarf families. Demand they stand by their oaths."
[Gandalf:] "What if I were to help you to reclaim it?"
[Gandalf:] "Yes, it does, which is why we are going to need a burglar."
[Gandalf:] "Did they see you? They saw you!"
[Gandalf:] "What did I tell you? Quiet as a mouse. Excellent burglar material."
[Gandalf:] "What form did it take? Like a bear?"
[Gandalf:] "There is a house, it’s not far from here, where we might take refuge."
[Gandalf:] "Neither. He will help us, or he will kill us."
[Gandalf:] "None."
[Gandalf:] "Come on!"
[Gandalf:] "This way, quickly!"
[Gandalf:] "To the house! Run!"
[Gandalf:] "Come on, get inside!"
[Gandalf:] "Open the door!"
[Gandalf:] "That...is our host."
[Gandalf:] "His name is Beorn, and he is a skin-changer."
[Gandalf:] "Sometimes he’s a huge black bear; sometimes he’s a great strong man. The bear is unpredictable, but the man can be reasoned with. However, he is not overfond of dwarves."
[Gandalf:] "Don’t be a fool; he’s under no enchantment but his own. Alright now, get some sleep, all of you. You’ll be safe here tonight."
[Gandalf:] "I hope."
[Gandalf:] "Before Durin’s Day falls, yes."
[Gandalf:] "Which is why we must go through Mirkwood."
[Gandalf:] "We will take the Elven Road. That path is still safe."
[Gandalf:] "The Elven Gate."
[Gandalf:] "Here lies our path through Mirkwood."
[Gandalf:] "Set the ponies loose. Let them return to their master."
[Gandalf:] "Not unless we go two hundred miles north, or twice that distance south."
[Gandalf:] "The High Fells. So be it."
[Gandalf:] "Not my horse! I need it."
[Gandalf:] "I would not do this unless I had to."
[Gandalf:] "You’ve changed, Bilbo Baggins. You’re not the same Hobbit as the one who left the Shire."
[Gandalf:] "Found what?"
[Gandalf:] "What did you find?"
[Gandalf:] "Good. Well, that’s good. You’ll need it."
[Gandalf:] "I’ll be waiting for you at the overlook, before the slopes of Erebor. Keep the map and key safe. Do not enter that mountain without me."
[Gandalf:] "This is not the Greenwood of old. The very air of the forest is heavy with illusion. It will seek to enter your mind and lead you astray."
[Gandalf:] "You must stay on the path; do not leave it. If you do, you will never find it again."
[Gandalf:] "No matter what may come, stay on the path!"
[Gandalf:] "Oh, it’s YOU!"
[Gandalf:] "Trust me, Radagast. I would not have called you here without good reason."
[Gandalf:] "No, it is not."
[Gandalf:] "If he had a name, it’s long since been lost. He would have been known only as a servant of evil. One of a number. One of nine."
[Gandalf:] "The Ringwraiths have been summoned to Dol Guldur."
[Gandalf:] "Who said it was human?"
[Gandalf:] "The Nine only answer to one master. We’ve been blind, Radagast, and in our blindness, the Enemy has returned."
[Gandalf:] "He is summoning his servants. Azog the Defiler is no ordinary hunter. He is a commander, a commander of legions. The enemy is preparing for war. It will begin in the east. His mind is set upon that mountain."
[Gandalf:] "To rejoin the others."
[Gandalf:] "I started this; I cannot forsake them. They are all in grave danger."
[Gandalf:] "You want me to cast my friends aside?"
[Gandalf:] "Dol Guldur. The hill of sorcery."
[Gandalf:] "As it is meant to. A spell of concealment lies over this place, which means our enemy is not yet ready to reveal himself. He has not regained his full strength. Radagast, I need you to carry a message to the Lady Galadriel. Tell her we must force his hand."
[Gandalf:] "I’m going in alone. On no account come after me. Do I have your word?"
[Gandalf:] "Turn around, and do not come back."
[Gandalf:] "It’s undoubtedly a trap."
[Gandalf:] "Cé ná ulco sís nurtaina…I ettuluvas caninye! Cánin i sá tanuvaxe!"
[Gandalf:] "Cé ná ulco sís nurtaina…I ettuluvas caninye! Cánin i sá tanuvaxe!"
[Gandalf:] "Where is your master?"
[Gandalf:] "Where is he??"
[Gandalf:] "Sauron."
[Gandalf:] "_ _ _"
[Gandalf:] "_ _ _"
[Gandalf:] "He is here."
[Gandalf:] "Come with me, my Lady."
[Gandalf:] "I need a horse!"
[Gandalf:] "To warn Erebor. They have no idea what is coming. I saw them with my own eyes - rank upon rank of Moria-orcs. You must summon our friends, bird and beast - the battle for the mountain is about to begin."
[Gandalf:] "Let me through!"
[Gandalf:] "Make way!"
[Gandalf:] "Who’s in charge here?!"
[Gandalf:] "You must set aside your petty grievances with the dwarves. War is coming! The cesspits of Dol Guldur have been emptied. You’re ALL in mortal danger!"
[Gandalf:] "Not this time. Armies of orcs are on the move. And these are fighters! They have been bred for war. Our enemy has summoned his full strength."
[Gandalf:] "Because we forced him! We forced him when the company of Thorin Oakenshield set out to reclaim their homeland. The dwarves were never meant to reach Erebor; Azog the Defiler was sent to kill them. His master seeks control of the mountain. Not just for the treasure within, but for where it lies, its strategic position."
[Gandalf:] "This is the gateway to reclaiming the lands of Angmar in the north. If that fell kingdom should rise again, Rivendell, Lothlorien, the Shire, even Gondor itself will fall!"
[Gandalf:] "Since when has my council counted for so little? What do you think I’m trying to do?!"
[Gandalf:] "You, Bowman! Do you agree with this? Is gold so important to you? Would you buy it with the blood of dwarves?!"
[Gandalf:] "Bilbo Baggins!"
[Gandalf:] "Rest up tonight. You must leave on tomorrow."
[Gandalf:] "Get as far away from here as possible."
[Gandalf:] "There is no company - not any more. And I don’t like to think what Thorin will do when he finds out what you’ve done."
[Gandalf:] "But you should be! Don’t underestimate the evil of gold. Gold over which a serpent has long brooded. Dragon-sickness seeps into the hearts of all who come near this mountain."
[Gandalf:] "Almost all."
[Gandalf:] "You there! Find this Hobbit a bed, and fill his belly with hot food. He has earned it."
[Gandalf:] "Hey. Keep an eye on him. If he should try to leave, you will tell me."
[Gandalf:] "IF YOU DON’T LIKE MY BURGLAR…"
[Gandalf:] "Then please don’t damage him. Return him to me! You’re not making a very splendid figure as king under the mountain, are you? Thorin son of Thrain!"
[Gandalf:] "Ironfoot."
[Gandalf:] "It is Dain, lord of the Iron Hills - Thorin’s cousin."
[Gandalf:] "I always found Thorin the more reasonable of the two."
[Gandalf:] "Come now, lord Dain!"
[Gandalf:] "There is no need for war between dwarves, men and elves! A legion of orcs march on the mountain. Stand your army down!"
[Gandalf:] "Were-worms!"
[Gandalf:] "Thranduil! This is madness!"
[Gandalf:] "Azog - he’s trying to cut us off"
[Gandalf:] "To the city! Bilbo! This way!"
[Gandalf:] "...you are the heir to the throne of Durin..."
[Gandalf:] "...take back...take Erebor..."
[Gandalf:] "...take back your homeland…"
[Gandalf:] "...this treasure will be your death…"
[Gandalf:] "They are rallying to their king!"
[Gandalf:] "We may yet survive this."
[Gandalf:] "And Fili, Kili...and Dwalin. He’s taking his best warriors!"
[Gandalf:] "To cut the head off the snake."
[Gandalf:] "Legolas... Legolas Greenleaf!"
[Gandalf:] "Gundabad…This was their plan all along. Azog engages our forces, then Bolg seeps in from the north."
[Gandalf:] "Ravenhill."
[Gandalf:] "My lord, dispatch this force to Ravenhill! The dwarves are about to be overrun. Thorin must be warned."
[Gandalf:] "Thranduil?!"
[Gandalf:] "Don’t be ridiculous! You’ll never make it!"
[Gandalf:] "Cause they will see you coming and kill you!"
[Gandalf:] "It’s out of the question - I won’t allow it!"
[Gandalf:] "Ah, the borders of the Shire. It is here I must leave you."
[Gandalf:] "You don’t really suppose, do you, that all your adventures and escapes were managed by mere luck?"
[Gandalf:] "Magic rings should not be used lightly, Bilbo."
[Gandalf:] "Don’t take me for a fool - I know you found one in the Goblin tunnels...and I’ve kept my eye on you ever since."
[Gandalf:] "Farewell."
[Gandalf:] "You’re a very fine person, Mister Baggins. And I’m very fond of you. But you’re only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all."
[Gandalf:] "And what about very old friends?!"
[Gandalf:] "Bilbo Baggins."
[Gandalf:] "Good to see you. One hundred eleven years old - who’d believe it?"
[Gandalf:]
"A Wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins,
nor is he early. He arrives precisely
when he means to."
[Gandalf:]
"You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle
Bilbo's birthday?"
[Gandalf:]
"What, everything? Far too eager and
curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural..."
[Gandalf:]
"Oh, well...that should please him."
[Gandalf:]
"Good gracious, me."
[Gandalf:]
"Oh, really?"
[Gandalf:]
"Indeed?"
[Gandalf:]
"If you're referring to the incident with
the Dragon...I was barely involved...all
I did was give your Uncle a little nudge
out the door."
[Gandalf:]
"Oh, really?"
[Gandalf:]
"So am I, dear boy...so am I"
[Gandalf:]
"And what about very old friends?"
[Gandalf:]
"Bilbo Baggins!"
[Gandalf:]
"It's good to see you. One hundred and
eleven years old, who would believe it!"
[Gandalf:]
"Just tea, thank you."
[Gandalf:]
"No, not at all. Go ahead. A sudden loud
knock on the front door."
[Gandalf:]
"So, you mean to go through with your
plan, then?"
[Gandalf:]
"Frodo suspects something."
[Gandalf:]
"You will tell him, won't you?"
[Gandalf:]
"He's very fond of you."
[Gandalf:]
"Meridoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took...I
might have known!"
[Gandalf:]
"I suppose you think that was terribly
clever?"
[Gandalf:]
"There are many magic rings in the world,
Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be
used lightly."
[Gandalf:]
"You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?"
[Gandalf:]
"What about this ring of yours?   Is that
staying too?"
[Gandalf:]
"I think you should leave the Ring behind,
Bilbo. Is that so hard?"
[Gandalf:]
"There's no need to get angry."
[Gandalf:]
"Precious? It's been called that before,
but not by you."
[Gandalf:]
"I think you've had that ring quite long
enough."
[Gandalf:]
"Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some
conjurer of cheap tricks!"
[Gandalf:]
"Bilbo?"
[Gandalf:]
"The ring is still in your pocket."
[Gandalf:]
"I'm sure you will, my dear friend."
[Gandalf:]
"Goodbye Bilbo."
[Gandalf:]
"Bilbo's ring."
[Gandalf:]
"I have some things I must see to."
[Gandalf:]
"Questions. Questions that need
answering."
[Gandalf:]
"Neither do I. Keep it secret, keep it
safe."
[Gandalf:]
"Hold out your hand, Frodo...it is quite
cool."
[Gandalf:]
"...these are markings."
[Gandalf:]
"This is the one ring forged by the dark
lord, Sauron, in the fires of Mt
Doom...taken by Isildur from the hand of
Sauron himself."
[Gandalf:]
"For sixty years the ring lay quiet in
Bilbo's keeping, prolonging his life,
delaying old age...but no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor. The ring has
awoken. It has heard its master's call."
[Gandalf:]
"No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron has
endured. His life force is bound to the
ring and the ring survived. Sauron has
returned. His Orcs have multiplied...his
fortress of Barad- dur is rebuilt in the
land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this
ring to cover all the lands in the second
darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it,
all his thought is bent on it. For the
ring yearns, above all else, to return to
the hand of its master: they are one, the
ring and the dark lord. Frodo, he must
never find out."
[Gandalf:]
"There is one other who knew that Bilbo
had the Ring. I looked everywhere for
the creature Gollum, but the enemy found
him first."
[Gandalf:]
"No, Frodo..."
[Gandalf:]
"You cannot offer me this ring."
[Gandalf:]
"Don't tempt me, Frodo. I dare not take
it, not even to keep it safe."
[Gandalf:]
"Understand, Frodo...I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good...but through
me, it would wield a power too great and
terrible to imagine."
[Gandalf:]
"No, no it can't."
[Gandalf:]
"You must leave, and leave quickly. Get
out of the Shire."
[Gandalf:]
"Make for the village of Bree."
[Gandalf:]
"I will, be waiting for you at the Inn of
the Prancing Pony. Frodo packs his food
into his knapsack."
[Gandalf:]
"I don't know, Frodo. I don't have any
answers. I must see the Head of my
Order. He is both wise and powerful.
Trust me, Frodo. He'll know what to do."
[Gandalf:]
"You'll have to leave the name of Baggins
behind you...for that name is not safe
outside the Shire."
[Gandalf:]
"My dear Frodo, Hobbits really are amazing
creatures. You can learn all that there
is to know about their ways in a month,
and yet, after a hundred years, they can
still surprise you."
[Gandalf:]
"It's a little late for trimming the
hedges, don't you think?"
[Gandalf:]
"What did you hear? Speak!"
[Gandalf:]
"No?"
[Gandalf:]
"Perhaps not. I've thought of a better
use for you."
[Gandalf:]
"Saruman!"
[Gandalf:]
"Beyond any doubt."
[Gandalf:]
"All these long years it was in the Shire,
under my very nose."
[Gandalf:]
"We still have time...time enough to
counter Sauron...if we act quickly."
[Gandalf:]
"You know this? How?"
[Gandalf:]
"A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman."
[Gandalf:]
"They are not all accounted for, the lost
seeing-stones...we do not know who else
may be watching."
[Gandalf:]
"Yes, I'm here and you're lucky to be
here, too. A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid. You have
some strength in you, my dear Hobbit."
[Gandalf:]
"I'm sorry Frodo."
[Gandalf:]
"There is only one Lord of the Ring. Only
one who can bend it to his will...and he
does not share power."
[Gandalf:]
"Nothing, Frodo..."
[Gandalf:]
"Sam has hardly left your side."
[Gandalf:]
"By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're
beginning to mend."
[Gandalf:]
"That wound will never fully heal. He will
carry it the rest of his life."
[Gandalf:]
"It is a burden he should never have to
had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo."
[Gandalf:]
"His treachery runs deeper than you know.
By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc
with Goblin Men...he is breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard. An army that
can move in Sunlight and cover great
distance at speed. Saruman is coming for
the Ring."
[Gandalf:]
"It is in Men that we must place our hope."
[Gandalf:]
"There is one who could unite them, one
who could re claim the thrown of Gondor."
[Gandalf:]
"Aragorn is right...we cannot use it."
[Gandalf:]
"Do you not understand? While we bicker
among ourselves, Sauron's power grows!
No one will escape it. You will all be
destroyed, your homes burnt and your
families put to the sword!"
[Gandalf:]
"I will help you bear this burden, Frodo
Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear."
[Gandalf:]
"No, Gimli. I would not take the road
through Moria unless I had no other
choice."
[Gandalf:]
"It's Saruman."
[Gandalf:]
"No!"
[Gandalf:]
"Let the ringbearer decide."
[Gandalf:]
"So be it."
[Gandalf:]
"Itidin...it mirrors only starlight and
moonlight."
[Gandalf:]
"Oh...mellon."
[Gandalf:]
"Into the mines!"
[Gandalf:]
"Quietly, now. It's a four day journey to
the other side. Let us hope that our
presence will go unnoticed."
[Gandalf:]
"I have no memory of this place."
[Gandalf:]
"He's been following us for three days."
[Gandalf:]
"Escaped...or was set loose. And now the
Ring has drawn him here...he will never
be rid of his need for it. He hates and
loves the ring, as he hates and loves
himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story."
[Gandalf:]
"Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's
hand. Many that live deserve death, and
some that die deserve life. Can you give
it to them, Frodo?"
[Gandalf:]
"So do all who live to see such times, but
that is not for them to decide. All we
have to decide is what to do with the
time that is given to us."
[Gandalf:]
"No, but the air doesn't smell so foul
down there. If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose!"
[Gandalf:]
"Let me risk a little more light."
[Gandalf:]
"Behold! The great realm and Dwarf city
of Dwarrowdelf!"
[Gandalf:]
"Gimli!!"
[Gandalf:]
""
[Gandalf:]
"I think there's more to this hobbit than
meets the eye."
[Gandalf:]
"To the bridge of Khazad-dum!"
[Gandalf:]
"This way!"
[Gandalf:]
"Lead them on, Aragorn. The bridge is
near."
[Gandalf:]
"You cannot pass!"
[Gandalf:]
"I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielderof the Flame of Anor!"
[Gandalf:]
"Argh! Go back to the shadow. The DarkFire will not avail you, Flame of Ud n![Camera zooms in through the mountainand focuses on Gandalf and the Balrogon the bridge of Khazad-d m. The Balrogstrikes down on Gandalf with its flamingsword. Gandalf parries the blow withGlamdring, shattering the Balrog s sword.]YOU  SHALL NOT... PASS!!!"
[Gandalf:]
"Argh!"
[Gandalf:]
"Fly, you fools!"
[Gandalf:]
"Through fire and water. [Flashback:Gandalf is battling the Balrog atopD rin s Tower.] From the lowest dungeonto the highest peak, I fought with theBalrog of Morgoth."
[Gandalf:]
"Until at last, I threw down my enemyand smote his ruin upon the mountainside."
[Gandalf:]
"Darkness took me. And I strayed outof thought and time. [Camera zooms inGandalf s eye and enters an amorphousrealm of stars and galaxies, endingin a blinding white light] Stars wheeledoverhead and everyday was as long asa life-age of the earth. But it wasnot the end. I felt life in me again."
[Gandalf:]
"I've been sent back until my task isdone."
[Gandalf:]
"Gandalf? Yes... That's what they usedto call me. Gandalf the Grey. That wasmy name."
[Gandalf:]
"One stage of your journey is over, anotherbegins. War has come to Rohan. We mustride to Edoras with all speed."
[Gandalf:]
"Shadowfax. [Gimli bows in the background.]He's the lord of all horses and he'sbeen my friend through many dangers."
[Gandalf:]
"Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan,whose mind is overthrown. Saruman'shold over King Theoden is now very strong."
[Gandalf:]
"Be careful what you say. Do not lookfor welcome here."
[Gandalf:]
"Hmm? [Glances at his staff.] Oh. Youwould not part an old man from his walkingstick?"
[Gandalf:]
"The courtesy of your hall is somewhatlessened of late, Theoden King."
[Gandalf:]
"Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behindyou teeth. I have not passed throughfire and death to bandy crooked wordswith a witless worm!"
[Gandalf:]
"Theoden, son of Thengel, too long haveyou sat in the shadows."
[Gandalf:]
"Hearken to me! I release you from thespell."
[Gandalf:]
"You did not kill me, you will not killhim!"
[Gandalf:]
"Be gone!!"
[Gandalf:]
"Breathe the free air again, my friend."
[Gandalf:]
"Your fingers would remember their oldstrength better... if they grasped yoursword."
[Gandalf:]
"Theodred's death was not of your making."
[Gandalf:]
"He was strong in life. His spirit willfind its way to the halls of your fathers.Westu hal. Ferou, Theodred, Ferou. (Be-thouwell. Go-thou, Theodred, go-thou.)"
[Gandalf:]
"This is but a taste of the terror thatSaruman will unleash. All the more potentfor he is driven now by fear of Sauron.Ride out and meet him head on. Drawhim away from your women and children.[Leans forward and puts a hand on Theoden'schair. Theoden looks at his hand warily.]You must fight."
[Gandalf:]
"Then what is the king's decision?"
[Gandalf:]
"There is no way out of that ravine.Theoden is walking into a trap. He thinkshe s leading them to safety. What theywill get is a massacre. Theoden hasa strong will but I fear for him. Ifear for the survival of Rohan. He willneed you before the end, Aragorn. Thepeople of Rohan will need you. The defensesHAVE to hold."
[Gandalf:]
"Theoden king stands alone."
[Gandalf:]
"Sauron's wrath will be terrible, hisretribution swift. The battle for Helm'sDeep is over. The battle for Middle-earthis about to begin. All our hopes nowlie with two little hobbits. Somewherein the wilderness."
[Gandalf:]
"And there Saruman must remain, under your
guard, Treebeard."
[Gandalf:]
"No word ... nothing."
[Gandalf:]
"Do we know that?"
[Gandalf:]
"Fool of a Took!"
[Gandalf:]
"Minas Tirith???
Is that what you saw?"
[Gandalf:]
"And what did you tell him? Speak!"
[Gandalf:]
"What did you tell him about Frodo and the
Ring?

INT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - DAY

THEODEN stands in the GOLDEN HALL, gravely listening to
GANDALF ... ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI look on . . .

[Gandalf:]
"
[Gandalf:]
"They will be.
(low voice, to Aragorn)
You must come to Minas Tirith by another
road ...
(cryptic)
Follow the river, look to the black ships.
(louder, to all)
Understand this . . . things are now in
motion that cannot be undone."
[Gandalf:]
"Of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin,
Took, you are the worst. Hurry, hurry!"
[Gandalf:]
"Three days ride as the Nazgul flies and
you'd better hope we don't have one of
those on our tail."
[Gandalf:]
"Run Shadowfax, show us the meaning of
haste."
[Gandalf:]
"We have just passed into the realm of
Gondor!"
[Gandalf:]
"Minas Tirith . . . City of the Kings."
[Gandalf:]
"Yes, the white tree of Gondor. The tree of
the King."
[Gandalf:]
"Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and
Steward of Gondor."
[Gandalf:]
"Come."
[Gandalf:]
"You're in the service of the Steward now -
you're going to have to do as you're told,
Peregrin Took . . .
(under his breath)
Guard of the Citadel!"
[Gandalf:]
"It's the deep breath before the plunge."
[Gandalf:]
"There never was much hope."
[Gandalf:]
"This will be the end of Gondor as we know
it. Here the hammerstroke will fall
hardest."
[Gandalf:]
"The Witchking of Angmar . . .
(he looks down at a startled
PIPPIN),.;
You've met him before . . ."
[Gandalf:]
"Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task to
be done. Another opportunity for one of the
Shire-folk to prove their great worth!"
[Gandalf:]
"Foreseen and done nothing!"
[Gandalf:]
"Where? When?"
[Gandalf:]
"Faramir! Your father's will has turned to
madness! Do not throw away your life so
rashly!"
[Gandalf:]
"Your father loves you, Faramir!
(quietly)
And will remember it before the end."
[Gandalf:]
"To the Gates! Man the Gates!"
[Gandalf:]
"Pull back - to the second level! Hurry! Get
the women and children out of here - get
them out!"
[Gandalf:]
"Fight! Fight for your lives!"
[Gandalf:]
"Come! Quickly!"
[Gandalf:]
"White shores ... And beyond . . . A far green
country under a swift sunrise."
[Gandalf:]
"Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The
darkness is deepening."
[Gandalf:]
"It's only a matter of time. He has suffered
a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of
Mordor our enemy is regrouping."
[Gandalf:]
"Because ten thousand Orcs now stand between
Frodo and Mount Doom."
[Gandalf:]
"How?"
[Gandalf:]
"Now come the days of the King ..."
[Gandalf:]
"Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work is now
finished. Here at last, on the shores of
the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship."
