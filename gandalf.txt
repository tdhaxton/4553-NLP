But there are\nothers in Middle Earth who can."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Hobbits are remarkably light on\ntheir feet! In fact, they can go\nunseen by most if they choose. And\nwhile the dragon is accustomed to\nthe smell of dwarf, the scent of a\nhobbit is all but unknown to him\nwhich gives us a distinct\nadvantage."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Very helpful, Fili."', '[Gandalf:]\n"You\'ve been sitting quietly for far\ntoo long. When did doliles and your\nmother\'s dishes become so important\nto you? I remember a young hobbit\nwho was always running off in\nsearch of elves in the woods.

A young hobbit\nwho would have liked nothing better\nthan to find out what was beyond\nthe borders of the Shire...\nThe world is not in your books and\nmaps. It\'s out there."', '[Gandalf:]\n"You are also a Took! Did you know\nthat your great-great-great-great\nuncle, Bullroarer Took was so large\nhe could ride a real horse?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Well, he could! In the Battle of\nGreen Fields, he charged the goblin\nranks. He swung his club so hard,\nit knocked the Goblin King\'s head\nclean off, and it sailed a hundred\nyards through the air and went down\na rabbit hole. And thus the battle\nwas won, and the game of golf\ninvented at the same time."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Well, all good stories deserve\nembellishment.

The greatest\nof our order is Saruman the White.\nThen there are the two blue\nwizards...\nYou know, I\'ve quite forgotten\ntheir names."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Well, that would be Radagast the\nBrown."', '[Gandalf:]\n"I think he is a very great wizard\nin his own way. He\'s a gently soul\nwho prefers the company of animals\nto others."', '[Gandalf:]\n"A farmer and his family used to\nlive here."', '[Gandalf:]\n"I think it would be wiser to move\non. We could make for the Hidden\nValley."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Why not?

Not since a\ndarker power ruled these lands. In\nany case, they could not have moved\nin daylight."', '[Gandalf:]\n"It\'s a troll hoard.

Are you sure?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Who did you tell about your quest,\nbeyond your kin."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Who did you tell?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"You are being hunted!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"These are Gundabad Wargs, they will\noutrun you!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Come on."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Move. Run!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"This way, you fools!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"I think that would be wise."', '[Gandalf:]\n"You can feel it?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"That\'s exactly what it is. A very\npowerful magic."', '[Gandalf:]\n"The Valley of Imraldis. In the\nCommon Tongue, it\'s known by\nanother name."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Here lies the last homely house\neast of the sea."', '[Gandalf:]\n"You have no enemies here, Thorin\nOakenshield.

Where have you been."', '[Gandalf:]\n"That may have been us."', '[Gandalf:]\n"No, master Gloin, he\'s offering you\nfood."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Kind of you to invite us. I\'m not\nreally dressed for dinner."', '[Gandalf:]\n"We found them in a troll hoard on\nthe Great East Road, shorty before\nwe were ambushed by orcs."', '[Gandalf:]\n"For goodness sake, Thorin, show him\nthe map."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Save me from the stubbornness of\ndwarves. Your pride will be your\ndownfall. You stand here in the\npresence of one of the few in\nMiddle Earth who can read that map.\nShow it to Lord Elrond!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"It\'s mainly academic. As you know,\nthis sort of artifact sometimes\ncontains hidden text. You still\nread ancient dwarvish, do you not?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Moon runes?

No, I\'m simply doing\nwhat I feel to be right."', '[Gandalf:]\n"It is true, my lady. Smaug owes\nallegiance to no one.

And I would say the same to you. Take back your homeland."', '[Gandalf:] "No, it is not. The Lonely Mountain troubles me, Thorin. That dragon has sat there long enough.

They mistook me for a vagabond."', '[Gandalf:] "One of them was carrying a message."', '[Gandalf:] "It is Black Speech."', '[Gandalf:] "Promise of payment."', '[Gandalf:] "Your head. Someone wants you dead. Thorin, you can wait no longer. You are the heir to the throne of Durin. Unite the armies of the dwarves. Together you have the might and power to retake Erebor.

Frodo, he must\nnever find out."', '[Gandalf:]\n"There is one other who knew that Bilbo\nhad the Ring. I looked everywhere for\nthe creature Gollum, but the enemy found\nhim first."', '[Gandalf:]\n"No, Frodo..."', '[Gandalf:]\n"You cannot offer me this ring."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Don\'t tempt me, Frodo. I dare not take\nit, not even to keep it safe."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Understand, Frodo...I would use this Ring\nfrom a desire to do good...but through\nme, it would wield a power too great and\nterrible to imagine."', '[Gandalf:]\n"No, no it can\'t."', '[Gandalf:]\n"You must leave, and leave quickly. Get\nout of the Shire."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Make for the village of Bree."', '[Gandalf:]\n"I will, be waiting for you at the Inn of\nthe Prancing Pony. Frodo packs his food\ninto his knapsack."', '[Gandalf:]\n"I don\'t know, Frodo. I don\'t have any\nanswers. I must see the Head of my\nOrder. He is both wise and powerful.\nTrust me, Frodo. He\'ll know what to do."', '[Gandalf:]\n"You\'ll have to leave the name of Baggins\nbehind you...for that name is not safe\noutside the Shire."', '[Gandalf:]\n"My dear Frodo, Hobbits really are amazing\ncreatures. You can learn all that there\nis to know about their ways in a month,\nand yet, after a hundred years, they can\nstill surprise you."', '[Gandalf:]\n"It\'s a little late for trimming the\nhedges, don\'t you think?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"What did you hear? Speak!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"No?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Perhaps not. I\'ve thought of a better\nuse for you."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Saruman!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Beyond any doubt."', '[Gandalf:]\n"All these long years it was in the Shire,\nunder my very nose."', '[Gandalf:]\n"We still have time...time enough to\ncounter Sauron...if we act quickly."', '[Gandalf:]\n"You know this? How?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman."', '[Gandalf:]\n"They are not all accounted for, the lost\nseeing-stones...we do not know who else\nmay be watching."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Yes, I\'m here and you\'re lucky to be\nhere, too. A few more hours and you\nwould have been beyond our aid. You have\nsome strength in you, my dear Hobbit."', '[Gandalf:]\n"I\'m sorry Frodo."', '[Gandalf:]\n"There is only one Lord of the Ring. Only\none who can bend it to his will...and he\ndoes not share power."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Nothing, Frodo..."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Sam has hardly left your side."', '[Gandalf:]\n"By the skills of Lord Elrond, you\'re\nbeginning to mend."', '[Gandalf:]\n"That wound will never fully heal. He will\ncarry it the rest of his life."', '[Gandalf:]\n"It is a burden he should never have to\nhad to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo."', '[Gandalf:]\n"His treachery runs deeper than you know.\nBy foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc\nwith Goblin Men...he is breeding an army\nin the caverns of Isengard. An army that\ncan move in Sunlight and cover great\ndistance at speed. Saruman is coming for\nthe Ring."', '[Gandalf:]\n"It is in Men that we must place our hope."', '[Gandalf:]\n"There is one who could unite them, one\nwho could re claim the thrown of Gondor."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Aragorn is right...we cannot use it."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Do you not understand? While we bicker\namong ourselves, Sauron\'s power grows!\nNo one will escape it. You will all be\ndestroyed, your homes burnt and your\nfamilies put to the sword!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"I will help you bear this burden, Frodo\nBaggins, as long as it is yours to bear."', '[Gandalf:]\n"No, Gimli. I would not take the road\nthrough Moria unless I had no other\nchoice."', '[Gandalf:]\n"It\'s Saruman."', '[Gandalf:]\n"No!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Let the ringbearer decide."', '[Gandalf:]\n"So be it."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Itidin...it mirrors only starlight and\nmoonlight."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Oh...mellon."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Into the mines!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Quietly, now. It\'s a four day journey to\nthe other side. Let us hope that our\npresence will go unnoticed."', '[Gandalf:]\n"I have no memory of this place."', '[Gandalf:]\n"He\'s been following us for three days."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Escaped...or was set loose. And now the\nRing has drawn him here...he will never\nbe rid of his need for it. He hates and\nloves the ring, as he hates and loves\nhimself. Smeagol\'s life is a sad story."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo\'s\nhand. Many that live deserve death, and\nsome that die deserve life. Can you give\nit to them, Frodo?"', '[Gandalf:]\n"So do all who live to see such times, but\nthat is not for them to decide. All we\nhave to decide is what to do with the\ntime that is given to us."', '[Gandalf:]\n"No, but the air doesn\'t smell so foul\ndown there. If in doubt, Meriadoc,\nalways follow your nose!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Let me risk a little more light."', '[Gandalf:]\n"Behold! The great realm and Dwarf city\nof Dwarrowdelf!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Gimli!!"', '[Gandalf:]\n""', '[Gandalf:]\n"I think there\'s more to this hobbit than\nmeets the eye."', '[Gandalf:]\n"To the bridge of Khazad-dum!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"This way!"', '[Gandalf:]\n"Lead them on, Aragorn. The bridge is\nnear."']
