FADE IN:
1 EXT. HOBBITON - DAY 1
WIDE ON: The sun rises over the village of HOBBITON. A
dense, orange glow is cast against the LITTLE RIVERS and
ROLLING HILLS.
2 EXT. BAG END - HOBBITON - DAY 2
CLOSE ON: A SMOKE RING floats in the morning sky. It wavers
gently in the wind, tranquil.
Suddenly, it collapses with a POP and transforms into a
SMOKE MOTH.
The moth FLUTTERS into the face of curly-haired hobbit BILBO
BAGGINS. The puff of smoke wakes him from his reverie. He
notices a grey figure standing in front of him.
WIDE ON: The wizard GANDALF THE GREY stands before Bilbo's
FENCE, watching.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo seems startled.
[Bilbo:]
Good morning.
[Gandalf:]"What do you mean? Do you mean to
wish me a good morning, or do you
mean that it is a good morning
whether I want it or not? Or,
perhaps you mean to say that you
feel good on this particular
morning, or are you simply stating
that this is a morning to be good
on?"
[Bilbo:]
All of them at once, I suppose?
Gandalf gives Bilbo a disapproving look. Bilbo looks simply
bewildered.

[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
I'm sorry, can I help you?
[Gandalf:]
"That remains to be seen. I'm
looking for someone to share in an
adventure."
Bilbo's PIPE drops from his mouth.
[Bilbo:]
An adventure? Now I don't imagine
anyone west of Bree would have much
interest in adventures. Nasty,
disturbing, uncomfortable things.
Make you late for dinner!
WIDE ON: Bilbo gets up and checks his mailbox.
ANGLE ON: He grabs some LETTERS and ENVELOPES and sorts
through them. After sparing Gandalf a brief glance, he turns
to leave.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
Good morning.
[Gandalf:]
"To think that I should have lived
to be good-morninged by Belladonna
Took's son as if I were selling
buttons at the door."
Bilbo whips around, startled at the mention of his mother.
[Bilbo:]
Beg your pardon?
[Gandalf:]
"You've changed, and not entirely
for the better, Bilbo Baggins."
[Bilbo:]
I'm sorry, do I know you?
[Gandalf:]
"Well, you know my name, although
you don't remember I belong to it.
"I'm Gandalf and Gandalf means me!"
A look of recognition flashes across Bilbo's face. His lips
curl into a smile.
(CONTINUED)

2 CONTINUED: (2) 2
[Bilbo:]
Not Gandalf, the wandering wizard,
who made such excellent fireworks!
Old Took used to have them on
Mid-Summer's Eve!
...
I had no idea you were still in
business.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf gives Bilbo a scathing look.
[Gandalf:]
"And where else should I be?"
[Bilbo:]
Well...
Bilbo's voice awkwardly TRAILS OFF. Sheepish, Bilbo takes
another whiff of his pipe.
[Gandalf:]
"Well, I'm pleased to find you
remember something about me, even
if it's only my fireworks. Well
then, that's decided. It will be
very good for you and most amusing
for me. I shall inform the others."
ANGLE ON: Bilbo grows pale with shock. He retreats further
towards Bag End.
[Bilbo:]
Inform the who? What? No, no, no!
We do not want any adventures here,
thank you! Not today! I suggest you
try somewhere over the hill or
across the water! Good morning!
In frustration, Bilbo storms into his home.
3 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - DAY 3
WIDE ON: Bilbo bolts the door shut behind him. Relieved, he
leans on it, catching his breath.
Suddenly, he hears a mysterious SCRAPPING NOISE on his door.
Bilbo listens closely, WONDERING.
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 4.
4 EXT. BAG END - HOBBITON - DAY 4
CLOSE ON: The noise is Gandalf, drawing a GLOWING RUNE onto
Bilbo's door with the edge of his STAFF.
5 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - DAY 5
Alarmed, Bilbo rushes to his window. He peers outside and
sees nothing but blue sky.
Suddenly, Gandalf's EYE is staring back at him through the
glass. Bilbo jumps back in fright, hiding out of sight.
Gandalf lingers outside the window, before turning and
leaving. Bilbo reenters the hallway and looks out of the
window. He sees Gandalf hurrying away from Bag End.
6 EXT. MARKETPLACE - HOBBITON - DAY 6
WIDE ON: Bilbo scurries toward the marketplace, a crazed
look in his eyes.
Numerous TENTS AND PAVILIONS are set up around the market.
Under their roofs, FOOD, DRINK, AND OTHER ITEMS are sold.
DOZENS OF HOBBITS waltz around the site, CHATTERING amongst
themselves. The women laugh, the men drink and the children
play.
ANGLE ON: A FISHERHOBBIT hands Bilbo his PACKAGED GOODS.
[Bilbo:]
Thank you.
Bilbo hurries away from the marketplace, eager to return
home. Just to be sure, Bilbo peers over his shoulder.
Nothing is there.
He looks back to the road before him, finding an elderly
hobbit, MASTER WORRYWORT, wheeling a cart towards him.
Worrywort pauses when he sees Bilbo.
[Worrywort:]
Hello, Mr. Bilbo! Here!
Worrywort holds up a LARGE, ROUND PLANT in front of Bilbo.
[Worrywort:] (CONT'D)
Have a feel of me tubers. Nice and
firm they are. Just came in from
West Farthing!
Bilbo gives the plant a brief touch.
(CONTINUED)

6 CONTINUED: 6
[Bilbo:]
Very impressive, Master Worrywort.
Now, I don't suppose you've seen a
wizard lurking about these parts?
[Worrywort:]
Tall fellow, long grey beard,
pointy hat. Can't say I have.
As Worrywort speaks, Bilbo spots the TIP OF A GREY HAT
moving behind a tent.
He sprints away from the marketplace, leaving Worrywort
behind. Bilbo hides himself next to a STONE BRIDGE, watching
as the hat makes its way past the tent.
The hat rounds a corner. It was only a BASKET OF GREY WOOL.
Bilbo steps out from the bridge, dazed.
7 EXT. BAG END - HOBBITON - NIGHT 7
WIDE ON: The sun creeps beneath the trees. One single, DRUNK
HOBBIT stumbles past Bag End, carrying a FLAGON OF WINE in
his hand.
SUPER: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY
8 INT. KITCHEN - BAG END - NIGHT 8
CLOSE ON: Two fish SIZZLE on a frying pan.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo loads them onto his plate, dressed in his
night-time robes. He settles down at the table, tucks a
napkin into his collar and begins to season his meal.
9 EXT. BAG END - HOBBITON - NIGHT 9
CLOSE ON: The rune on the door GLIMMERS in the night. The
SHADOW OF A DWARF spreads over the door.
10 INT. KITCHEN - BAG END - NIGHT 10
WIDE ON: From outside, the DOORBELL RINGS. Bilbo looks up in
surprise.
11 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - NIGHT 11
ANGLE ON: Bilbo opens his door. He finds a bald, muscular
dwarf, DWALIN, standing at his doorstep. He greets Bilbo
with a slight bow.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 6.
11 CONTINUED: 11
[Dwalin:]
Dwalin, at your service.
Bilbo lets out a CONFUSED WHIMPER. Coming to his senses, he
quickly ties his robe together and stands taller, but the
confused look on his face still remains.
[Bilbo:]
Bilbo Baggins, at yours.
Dwalin steps inside without invitation.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
Sorry, do we know each other?
[Dwalin:]
No. Which way, laddie? Is it down
here?
[Bilbo:]
Is what down where?
Dwalin takes off his COAT and throws it to Bilbo. The poor
hobbit barely manages to catch the thing.
[Dwalin:]
Supper. He said there'd be food and
lots of it.
The dwarf strides down the hallway, as if it were his own.
Bilbo stares after him, befuddled.
[Bilbo:]
He said? Who said?
12 INT. KITCHEN - BAG END - NIGHT 12
Dwalin sits at Bilbo's spot at the table, scarfing down the
fish. Bilbo watches him eat, disgusted.
CLOSE ON: Dwalin scarfs down all the flesh off from the
fish. He drops the BONES onto the plate, wiping his hands on
his beard.
[Dwalin:]
Very good, this. Any more?
[Bilbo:]
What? Oh, yes.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 7.
12 CONTINUED: 12
ANGLE ON: Bilbo awkwardly brings over a PLATE OF BISCUITS.
He manages to hide one behind his back for himself.
Dwalin grabs most of the biscuits and stuffs them down his
mouth.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
It's just that I wasn't expecting
company.
CLOSE ON: The DOORBELL RINGS once again. Bilbo looks up in
alarm.
[Dwalin:]
That'll be the door.
Dwalin stares up at him, GREASE staining his beard.
13 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - NIGHT 13
ANGLE ON: Bilbo opens the door once again. He finds another
dwarf standing before him. BALIN. The much older dwarf gives
a ginger bow.
[Balin:]
Balin, at your service.
[Bilbo:]
Good evening.
[Balin:]
Yes, yes, it is. Though, I think it
might rain later. Am I late?
[Bilbo:]
Late for what?
Balin spots Dwalin in the hallway, trying to get more
biscuits from the JAR.
[Balin:]
Oh! Evening brother!
Dwalin puts the jar down with a smile. The two brothers
approach each other.
[Dwalin:]
By my beard, you are shorter and
wider than last we met.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 8.
13 CONTINUED: 13
[Balin:]
Wider, not shorter. But sharp
enough for the both of us.
CLOSE ON: The two share a CHUCKLE as Bilbo looks on,
confused.
14 INT. PANTRY - BAG END - NIGHT 14
ANGLE ON: Dwalin and Balin have gone into the pantry,
helping themselves to ALE and examining the FOOD.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo steps into the room.
[Bilbo:]
It's not that I don't like
visitors, I like visitors as much
as the next hobbit. But I do like
to know them before they come
visiting.
ANGLE ON: The dwarves continue to riffle through the pantry,
ignoring their host.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo sheepishly presses on.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
The thing is, I don't know any of
you. Not in the slightest. I don't
mean to be blunt, but I had to
speak my mind. I'm sorry.
Dwalin and Balin pause and look at Bilbo.
[Balin:]
Apology accepted.
Bilbo nods, satisfied.
ANGLE ON: Balin hands a TANKARD to his brother.
[Balin:] (CONT'D)
Now, fill it up, brother, don't
stint!
From the hallway, the DOORBELL RINGS once again. Bilbo
slowly turns around, at awe with shock.
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 9.
15 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - NIGHT 15
ANGLE ON: For the third time, Bilbo opens the door. He finds
two young dwarves, FILI and KILI, standing before him. Bilbo
GROANS.
[Fili:]
Fili.
[Kili:]
And Kili.
(with Fili)
At your service.
They both give a courteous bow.
[Kili:] (CONT'D)
You must be Mr. Boggins!
[Bilbo:]
Nope, you can't come in, you've
come to the wrong house.
Bilbo tries to close the door. Kili manages to stop it with
his feet.
[Kili:]
Has it been cancelled?
[Fili:]
No one told us!
[Bilbo:]
Cancelled? No, nothing's been
cancelled!
[Kili:]
That's a relief!
The dwarves push their way in and begin to unload their
WEAPONS onto Bilbo.
[Fili:]
Careful with these. We just had
them sharpened.
Kili admires the architecture of the hallway.
[Kili:]
It's nice, this place. Did you do
it yourself?
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 10.
15 CONTINUED: 15
[Bilbo:]
No, it's been in the family for
years.
Kili begins to scrape the mud off his boots on the edge of a
NEARBY CHEST.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
That's my mother's glory box, could
you please not do that!
Dwalin enters the hallway and beckons Fili and Kili forward.
[Dwalin:]
Fili, Kili, come on, give us a
hand!
[Kili:]
Mr. Dwalin!
The two brothers follow Dwalin down the hall and into the
dining room. Bilbo begins to follow behind them, at a loss
for words.
[Balin:] (O.S.)
Let's shove this in the hallway,
otherwise we'll never get everyone
in.
[Bilbo:]
Everyone? How many more are there.
[Balin:] (O.S.)
Not many.
The DOORBELL RINGS AGAIN!
Enraged, Bilbo quickly walks to the door. Along the way, he
dumps the swords and equipment he is carrying onto the
ground.
[Bilbo:]
No! There's nobody home! Go away
and bother somebody else! There's
far too many dwarves in my dining
room as it is. If this is some
clotterd's idea of a joke, I can
only say that it is in very poor
taste.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 11.
15 CONTINUED: (2) 15
Bilbo throws open the door. Two more dwarves stand outside,
OIN and GLOIN. Bilbo is shocked to see Gandalf standing
behind them.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
Gandalf?
The wizard gives a faint smile.
16 INT. PANTRY - BAG END - NIGHT 16
CLOSE ON: The dwarves raid Bilbo's pantry. CHEESE, MEAT,
WINE, VEGGIES, FRUITS; every food under the sun. And they
are all wrenched from the PANTRY SHELVES.
17 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - NIGHT 17
WIDE ON: Bilbo steps into the hall, seeing the dwarves cross
from pantry to dining room and back again. He steps forward.
[Bilbo:]
Excuse me, that's my chicken! Oh,
not my wine! Put that back! Put
that back!
ANGLE ON: Gloin and Fili pass Bilbo. Gloin carries THREE
WHEELS OF CHEESE.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
That's a tad excessive, don't you
think? Do you have a cheese knife?
[Fili:]
Cheese knife? He eats it by the
block.
Bilbo turns his attention to Oin, who carries WOODEN CHAIRS
at his side.
[Bilbo:]
No, that's Grandpa Mungo's chair!
Oin holds up a METAL TRUMPET to his ear.
[Oin:]
I can't hear what you're saying,
laddie.
He manages to wrangle free of Bilbo and enters the dining
room.
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 12.
18 INT. DINING ROOM - BAG END - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 18
Oin neatly sets the chairs down beside Gandalf. The wizard
helps the others set the table. Balin approaches the wizard,
carrying a TEA TRAY.
[Balin:]
Excuse me, Gandalf, may I tempt you
with a cup of chamomile tea?
[Gandalf:]
"Oh, no thank you, Balin. A little
red wine for me, I think."
With a nod, Balin walks off. Gandalf exits the dining room,
ducking so as to not hit the doorway.
19 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 19
CLOSE ON: Gandalf walks into the central hub of the hallway.
He looks down, and starts to count the dwarves on his hands
as they pass by.
[Gandalf:]
"Fili, Kili, Oin, Gloin, Balin and
Dwalin. We appear to be one dwarf
short."
Dwalin lounges in a near corner.
[Dwalin:]
He is late, is all. He travelled
North to a meeting of our kin. He
will come.
Balin approaches Gandalf, GLASS OF WINE in hand.
[Balin:]
As you requested, a glass of red
wine. It's got a fruity bouquet.
[Gandalf:]
"Cheers!"
Gandalf gulps down the lush, red wine.
20 INT. DINING ROOM - BAG END - NIGHT 20
ANGLE ON: All the dwarves are seated around Bilbo's dining
room table. They are messy about preparing and eating their
food.
Gandalf sits in the middle of the chaos, calm and collected.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 13.
20 CONTINUED: 20
CLOSE ON: Fili sits at the end of the table. He grabs a LOAF
OF BREAD from out of a basket.
[Fili:]
Gloin! Catch!
He throws the bread across the table, towards Gloin.
ANGLE ON: Gloin CATCHES IT IN HIS MOUTH. The dwarves APPLAUD
UPROARIOUSLY.
21 INT. PANTRY - BAG END - NIGHT 21
CLOSE ON: Bilbo watches the dwarves feast. It is clear that
he is disgusted. Quickly, he turns to face the pantry.
WIDE ON: It is completely cleared of food.
22 INT. KITCHEN - BAG END - NIGHT 22
ANGLE ON: Kili enters the kitchen, using a DOILY to wipe his
face. Bilbo comes in behind him and rips the doily out of
Kili's hands.
[Bilbo:]
Excuse me, that is a doily, not a
dishcloth.
Fili lounges against the near fireplace.
[Fili:]
But it's full of holes.
[Bilbo:]
It's supposed to look like that,
it's crochet.
[Fili:]
Oh, and a wonderful game it is too,
if you've got the balls for it.
Kili LAUGHS at his brother's jest. Bilbo throws the doily
down onto the table, infuriated.
[Bilbo:]
Bebother and confusticate these
dwarves!
Gandalf enters the kitchen, concerned.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 14.
22 CONTINUED: 22
[Gandalf:]
"My dear Bilbo, what on earth is the
matter?"
[Bilbo:]
What's the matter? I'm surrounded
by dwarves! What are they doing
here?
Kili hoists a CHAIN OF SAUSAGES over his shoulder. Fili
grabs one end, trying to take them from him. Gandalf
observes the scuffle, amused.
[Gandalf:]
"They're quite a merry gathering,
once you get used to them."
[Bilbo:]
I don't want to get used to them!
Bilbo leads Gandalf into the hallway.
23 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 23
Bilbo points to a MUD SPLATTERED RUG.
[Bilbo:]
There's mud trod into the carpet,
they've pillaged the pantry! I'm
not even going to tell you what
they've done in the bathroom;
they've all but destroyed the
plumbing! I don't understand what
they're doing in my house!
Balin approaches the pair, tapping Bilbo on the shoulder.
[Balin:]
Sorry, I hate to interrupt, but
where would you like me to put my
plate.
Fili enters the hallway.
[Fili:]
Here you go, Balin, give it to me.
Fili takes the PLATE, quickly turning and throwing it to
Kili, standing at the doorway. Kili throws the dish into the
kitchen, where -
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 15.
24 INT. KITCHEN - BAG END - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 24
CLOSE ON: Oin stands beside the SINK, catching all of the
plates and putting them neatly into the sink.
25 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - NIGHT 25
Bilbo watches as the dish throwing cycle continues.
[Bilbo:]
Excuse me, that's my mother's West
Farthing crokery, it's over a
hundred years old!
ANGLE ON: The dwarves ignore him, and continue to throw the
plates about. Bilbo hears BEATING and SCRAPING from the
dining room. He goes to investigate.
26 INT. DINING ROOM - BAG END - NIGHT 26
CLOSE ON: Dwalin and Gloin sit at the table, rhythmically
DRUMMING on the table with their UTENSILS.
[Bilbo:]
Could you please not do that?
You'll blunt them!
[Gloin:]
You hear that, lads? He says we'll
blunt the knives.
27 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 27
ANGLE ON: Fili and Kili continue to throw the dishes around,
singing to the beat of the BANGING UTENSILS.
[Kili:]
(singing)
Blunt the knives, bend the forks!
[Fili:]
(singing)
Smash the bottles and burn the
corks!
[All Dwarves:]
(singing)
Smash the bottles and crack the
plates! That's what Bilbo Baggins
hates!
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 16.
28 INT. BAG END - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 28
The dwarves continue to throw the dishes from the dining
room, to the hallway, to the kitchen and back to the dining
room, singing all the while
[All Dwarves:]
(singing)
Cut the cloth, tread on fat! Leave
the bones on the bedroom mat! Pour
the milk on the pantry floor,
splash the wine on every door! Dump
the crocks in a boiling bowl, pound
them up with a thumping pole! When
you're finished, if they are whole,
send them down the hall to roll!
That's what Bilbo Baggins hates!
Bilbo rushes around his house, frantic and panicked.
29 INT. DINING ROOM - BAG END - NIGHT 29
CLOSE ON: Bilbo sprints into the dining room.
ANGLE ON: Gandalf and the dwarves are circled around the
table, LAUGHING. All of the dishes are stacked neatly on the
table, SPARKLY CLEAN. Bilbo is relieved.
Suddenly, there is a LOUD KNOCK at the door. Everyone goes
quiet.
[Gandalf:]
"He is here."
30 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - NIGHT 30
ANGLE ON: The door opens. There, standing on the doorstep,
is the noble looking THORIN OAKENSHIELD.
[Thorin:]
Gandalf, I thought you said this
place would be easy to find. I lost
my way, twice. I wouldn't have
found it at all had it not been for
that mark on the door.
WIDE ON: Gandalf shuts the door behind Thorin. All the
dwarves bow at his presence. Bilbo pushes through the crowd,
entering the hall.
[Bilbo:]
Mark? There's no mark on that door,
it was pained a week ago.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 17.
30 CONTINUED: 30
[Gandalf:]
"There is a mark; I put it there
myself. Bilbo Baggins, allow me to
introduce the leader of our
company, Thorin Oakenshield."
ANGLE ON: Thorin steps towards Bilbo. There is STARK
JUDGEMENT in his eyes.
[Thorin:]
So, this is the hobbit. Tell me,
Mr. Baggins, have you done much
fighting?
[Bilbo:]
Pardon me?
[Thorin:]
Axe or sword? What is your weapon
of choice?
[Bilbo:]
Well, I do have some skill at
Conkers, if you must know, but I
fail to see why that's relevant.
[Thorin:]
Thought as much. He looks more like
a grocer than a burglar.
The dwarves LAUGH at Thorin's jest. He gives them a warm
smile and walks himself down the hall.
31 INT. DINING ROOM - BAG END - NIGHT 31
The dwarves sit around the table with Thorin, who picks at
some SOUP. Gandalf sits beside him, smoking a pipe. Bilbo
watches from the doorway.
[Balin:]
What news from the meeting in Ered
Luin? Did they all come?
[Thorin:]
Aye. Envoys from all seven
kingdoms.
The dwarves MURMUR IN EXCITEMENT.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 18.
31 CONTINUED: 31
[Dwalin:]
What did the dwarves of the Iron
Hills say? Is Dain with us?
CLOSE ON: Thorin hesitates, frowning. All eyes are on him.
[Thorin:]
They will not come.
ANGLE ON: The dwarves GASP and EXCLAIM in disappointment.
[Thorin:] (CONT'D)
They say this quest is ours and
ours alone.
[Bilbo:]
You're going on a quest?
Bilbo looks to the dwarves, confused. Gandalf taps him on
the shoulder.
[Gandalf:]
"Bilbo, my dear fellow, let us have
a little more light."
Bilbo leaves the room and comes back with a CANDLE. He sets
it down near Gandalf, who has pulled out A MAP and is
spreading it across the table.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
"Far to the east, over ranges and
rivers, beyond woodlands and
wastelands, lies a single solitary
peak."
CLOSE ON: Gandalf points to a peak drawn on the map. THE
LONELY MOUNTAIN.
[Bilbo:]
The Lonely Mountain?
ANGLE ON: Bilbo peers down at the map.
CLOSE ON: He notices a RED DRAGON drawn beside the mountain.
[Gloin:]
Aye! Oin has read the portents and
the portents say it is time.
ANGLE ON: The other dwarves GROAN. They have heard this all
before.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 19.
31 CONTINUED: (2) 31
[Oin:]
Ravens have been seen flying back
to the mountain as it was foretold:
when the birds of yore return to
Erebor, the reign of the beast will
end.
Bilbo looks up from the map, concerned.
[Bilbo:]
What beast?
[Fili:]
Well, that would be a reference to
Smaug the Terrible, chiefest and
greatest calamity of our age.
Airborne fire-breather, teeth like
razors, claws like meathooks.
Extremely fond of precious metals.
[Bilbo:]
Yes, I know what a dragon is.
[Balin:]
The task to win back the mountain
would be difficult enough with an
army behind us. But we number just
seven, and not seven of the best.
The dwarves object to this insult, SHOUTING RETORTS AND
PROTESTS.
[Gloin:]
We may be few in numbers, but we're
fighters. All of us, to the last
dwarf.
[Kili:]
And you forget, we have a wizard in
our company. Gandalf must have
killed hundreds of dragons in his
time.
[Gandalf:]
"Well, no, I wouldn't say that I -"
[Fili:]
How many then?
[Gandalf:]
"What?"
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 20.
31 CONTINUED: (3) 31
[Fili:]
How many dragons have you killed?
Go on, give us a number!
CLOSE ON: An embarrassed Gandalf starts to COUGH on his pipe
smoke. The dwarves GROAN, hopeless.
ANGLE ON: Thorin rises to his feet.
[Thorin:]
If we have read these signs, do you
not think others will have read
them too? Rumours have begun to
spread. The dragon Smaug has not
been seen for sixty years. Eyes
look east to the mountain,
assessing, wondering, weighing the
risk. Perhaps the vast wealth of
our people now lies unprotected. Do
we sit back as others claim what is
rightfully ours? Or do we seize
this chance to take back Erebor?
Inspired by the speech, the dwarves JUMP AND CHEER. Balin
gets to his feet and RAISES HIS VOICE.
[Balin:]
You forget, the front gate is
sealed! There is no way into the
mountain.
[Gandalf:]
"That, my dear Balin, is not
entirely true."
CLOSE ON: With a twiddle of his fingers, Gandalf produces a
DWARVISH KEY, ornately wrought. Thorin looks at it in
wonder.
[Thorin:]
How came you by this?
[Gandalf:]
"It was given to me by your father,
by Thrain, for safe keeping. It is
yours now."
ANGLE ON: Gandalf hands the key to Thorin. Everyone looks on
in a proud astonishment.

[Kili:]
If there is a key, there must be a
door.
[Gandalf:]
"These ruins speak of another
passage into the lower halls."
The wizard points to RUNES on the map.
[Fili:]
There's another way in.
[Gandalf:]
"Well, if we can find it, but dwarf
doors are invisible when closed.
The answer lies hidden somewhere in
this map and I do not have the
skill to find it. But there are
others in Middle Earth who can."
The dwarves look to him, listening carefully.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
"The task I have in mind will
require a great deal of stealth,
and no small amount of courage.
But, if we are careful and clever,
I believe that it can be done."
[Oin:]
That's why we need a burglar.
[Bilbo:]
A good one too. An expert, I'd
imagine.
[Gloin:]
And are you?
Bilbo freezes, half confused, half afraid.
[Bilbo:]
Am I what?
[Oin:]
He said he's an expert!
CLOSE ON: Several dwarves CHUCKLE WITH JOY. Bilbo's face is
livid with shock.

THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 22.
31 CONTINUED: (5) 31
[Bilbo:]
Me? No, no, no, I'm not a burglar.
I've never stolen a thing in my
life.
[Balin:]
I'm afraid I have to agree with Mr.
Baggins. He's hardly burglar
material.
[Dwalin:]
Aye, the wild is no place for
gentlefolk who can neither fight
nor fend for themselves.
Bilbo nods in desperate agreement, ignoring the insult.
Gandalf shakes his head, irritated.
[Gandalf:]
"Hobbits are remarkably light on
their feet! In fact, they can go
unseen by most if they choose. And
while the dragon is accustomed to
the smell of dwarf, the scent of a
hobbit is all but unknown to him
which gives us a distinct
advantage."
ANGLE ON: Gandalf turns to Thorin, determined to make his
point.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
"You asked me to find the eighth
member of this company and I have
chosen Mr. Baggins. There's a lot
more to him than appearances
suggest, and he's got a great deal
to offer than any of you know,
including himself. You must trust
me on this."
Thorin SIGHS. He scans the room, weighing the outcome.
[Thorin:]
Very well, we'll do it your way.
(turns to Balin)
Give him our contract.
Balin hands a SCROLLED CONTRACT to Bilbo.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 23.
31 CONTINUED: (6) 31
[Balin:]
It's just the usual summary of out
of pocket expenses, time required,
remuneration, funeral arrangements
and so forth.
[Bilbo:]
Funeral arrangements?
Bilbo takes the contract reluctantly. He unrolls the scroll,
which nearly reaches the floor.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
Terms: cash on delivery, up to, but
not exceeding one eighth of total
profit, if any. Present company
shall not be liable for injuries
inflicted by or sustained as a
consequence thereof, including, but
not limited to - lacerations?
Evisceration? Incineration?
[Fili:]
Oh, he'll melt the flesh off your
bones in the blink of an eye.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo seems breathless. He drops the contract to
his side, holding a hand to his chest.
[Balin:]
You alright, laddie?
[Bilbo:]
Yes, but I feel a bit faint.
[Fili:]
Think furnace with wings. Flash of
light, searing pain, then - POOF!
You're nothing more than a pile of
ash!
Bilbo starts PANTING, trying to compose himself as the
others look on. Finally, Bilbo rises, turning to Balin.
[Bilbo:]
Nope.
ANGLE ON: He FAINTS onto the floor. Gandalf shakes his head,
glaring at Fili.

32 INT. SITTING ROOM - BAG END - NIGHT 32
Bilbo sits at his chair, shivering and clutching a MUG.
[Bilbo:]
I'll be alright, just let me sit
quietly for a moment.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf gazes down at him, a look of
disappointment in his eyes.
[Gandalf:]
"You've been sitting quietly for far
too long. When did doliles and your
mother's dishes become so important
to you? I remember a young hobbit
who was always running off in
search of elves in the woods. He'd
stay out late, trailing mud and
twigs and fireflies. A young hobbit
who would have liked nothing better
than to find out what was beyond
the borders of the Shire...
The world is not in your books and
maps. It's out there."
ANGLE ON: He points to the window in the room. It gleams in
the PEARLY MOONLIGHT.
[Bilbo:]
I can't just go running off into
the blue! I am a Baggins of Bag
End!
[Gandalf:]
"You are also a Took! Did you know
that your great-great-great-great
uncle, Bullroarer Took was so large
he could ride a real horse?"
[Bilbo:]
Yes.
[Gandalf:]
"Well, he could! In the Battle of
Green Fields, he charged the goblin
ranks. He swung his club so hard,
it knocked the Goblin King's head
clean off, and it sailed a hundred
yards through the air and went down
a rabbit hole. And thus the battle
was won, and the game of golf
invented at the same time."
[Bilbo:]
I do believe you made that up.
Gandalf sits himself across from Bilbo.
[Gandalf:]
"Well, all good stories deserve
embellishment. You'll have a tale
or two to tell of your own when you
come back."
[Bilbo:]
Can you promise that I will come
back?
[Gandalf:]
"No. But if you do, you will not be
the same."
[Bilbo:]
That's what I thought. I'm sorry,
Gandalf, but I can't sign this.
You've got the wrong hobbit.
Bilbo leaves the contract on the mantle and exits the
sitting room. Gandalf watches him leave, disappointed.
33 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - NIGHT 33
CLOSE ON: Thorin and Balin stand in the hallway, watching
Bilbo enter his bedroom. Balin SIGHS.
[Balin:]
It appears we have lost our
burglar. Probably for the best. The
odds were always against us. After
all, what are we? Merchants,
miners, tinkers, toy-makers; hardly
the stuff of legend.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 26.
33 CONTINUED: 33
[Thorin:]
There are a few warriors amongst
us.
[Balin:]
Old warriors.
[Thorin:]
I will take each and every one of
these dwarves over an army from the
Iron Hills. For when I called upon
them, they came. Loyalty, honor, a
willing heart; I can ask no more
than that.
[Balin:]
You don't have to do this. You have
a choice. You've done honorably by
our people. You have built us a new
life for us in the Blue Mountains,
a life of peace and plenty. A life
that is worth more than all the
gold in Erebor.
Thorin withdraws the Dwarvish key from his pocket. He holds
it before Balin for him to see.
[Thorin:]
From my grandfather to my father,
this has come to me. They dreamt of
the day when the dwarves of Erebor
would reclaim their homeland. There
is no choice, Balin. Not for me.
[Balin:]
Then we are with you, laddie. We'll
see it done.
With a DEEP SIGH, Balin places a supportive hand on Thorin's
shoulder.
34 INT. SITTING ROOM - BAG END - NIGHT 34
WIDE ON: All seven dwarves sit around the fire in the dark
sitting room. They HUM A SOMBER TUNE. Smoking his pipe near
the mantle, Thorin begins to SING.

[Thorin:]
(singing)
Far over the Misty Mountain cold,
to dungeons deep and caverns old,
we must away ere break of day to
find our long forgotten gold.
The rest of the dwarves rise from their seats, joining in
with Thorin.
[All Dwarves:]
(singing)
The pines were roaring on the
height, the winds were moaning in
the night, the fire was red, its
flaming spread, the trees like
torches blazed with light.
Gandalf stands near the window, staring out and listening to
the song.
35 INT. BEDROOM - BAG END - NIGHT 35
ANGLE ON: Bilbo sits on the edge of his bed, listening to
the dwarves sing. He stares into his fire, watching the
smoke slowly rise.
36 EXT. BAG END - HOBBITON - NIGHT 36
WIDE ON: EMBERS FLUTTER out of Bilbo's chimney and into the
starry night sky.
37 INT. BEDROOM - BAG END - DAY 37
The morning light streams into Bilbo's bedroom.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo wakes, squinting at the sunlight. Suddenly,
he notices how quiet the house is.
38 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - DAY 38
ANGLE ON: Bilbo sneaks around the hallway, peering into all
of the doorways. They are all empty.
[Bilbo:]
Hello?
He discovers that the mess of the party has been cleaned,
almost as if it never happened.
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 28.
39 INT. SITTING ROOM - BAG END - DAY 39
Victorious, Bilbo waltzes into the sitting room. He gazes at
the tidiness of the room, smiling. Slowly, his joy deflates,
leaving him almost defeated.
He wanders deeper into the room, stopping next to a table.
The contract lies there, unsigned. Bilbo stares long and
hard at it, thinking.
Suddenly, he looks up, determined.
40 EXT. HOBBITON - DAY 40
CRANE SHOT: Bilbo darts out of his home and down the hill. A
TRAVELING PACK is strapped to his back, the contract
flapping in the wind behind him.
ANGLE ON: He jumps over fences, animals and crops. He
sprints past BEFUDDLED NEIGHBORS who shake their heads in
disapproval.
WIDE ON: Finally, Bilbo passes the last round of houses.
There, Master Worrywort stands at his fence. He sees Bilbo
and gives him a SIDEWAYS LOOK.
[Worrywort:]
Mr. Bilbo, where are you off to?
[Bilbo:]
Can't stop, I'm already late!
[Worrywort:]
Late for what?
[Bilbo:]
I'm going on an adventure!
With a grin, Bilbo leaves his home behind him and rushes
into the world ahead.
41 EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF HOBBITON - DAY 41
The Company is trotting down a dirt road, leaving the Shire.
The dwarves are mounted on PONIES, their luggage tied behind
them. As they ride, most exchange SOUR WORDS about Bilbo.
[Bilbo:]
Wait!
CLOSE ON: Bilbo rushes down the road after them.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 29.
41 CONTINUED: 41
ANGLE ON: Gandalf and the dwarves stop their horses and turn
to see Bilbo. He waves the contract above his head,
grinning.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
I signed it!
He hands the contract over to Balin, who inspects it with a
pair of EYEGLASSES.
[Balin:]
Everything appears to be in order.
Welcome, Master Baggins, to the
company of Thorin Oakenshield.
The dwarves give INDIFFERENT APPLAUSE.
CLOSE ON: Thorin looks thoroughly unimpressed.
[Thorin:]
Give him a pony.
[Bilbo:]
No, no, that won't be necessary,
I'm sure I can keep up on foot.
I've done my fair share of walking
holidays, you know. I even got as
far as Frogmorton once.
Two dwarves ride alongside Bilbo and hoist him upwards.
42 EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF HOBBITON - DAY - LATER 42
ANGLE ON: Bilbo rides his pony, glaring down at the animal
and shriveling up his nose.
Suddenly, Bilbo SNEEZES LOUDLY.
[Bilbo:]
Oh, all this horse hair. I'm having
a reaction.
He searches in his pocket for something. Unable to find it,
he looks up in panic.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
Wait! Wait! Stop! We have to turn
around.
WIDE ON: The entire company comes to a halt.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 30.
42 CONTINUED: 42
[Gandalf:]
"My dear Bilbo, what on earth is the
matter?"
[Bilbo:]
I forgot my handkerchief!
ANGLE ON: From the front of the line, Fili tears a STRIP OF
CLOTH from his shirt. He tosses it to Bilbo.
[Fili:]
Here, use this!
Bilbo catches the rag and looks at it in disgust.
[Thorin:]
Move on!
The dwarves LAUGH, resuming their journey.
43 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - ERIADOR - DAY 43
CRANE SHOT: The Company travels through VAST, ROLLING HILLS
and PLAINS. Forests are visible in the distance, darkness
creeping between the trees.
[Gandalf:] (V.O.)
"You'll have to manage without
pocket-handkerchiefs and a good
many other things, Bilbo Baggins,
before we reach our journey's end.
You were born to the rolling hills
and little rivers of the Shire, but
home is now behind you; the world
is ahead."
Now, the company treks up a MOUNTAINSIDE, which looms over
the flat plains below. The sun sets behind them.
44 EXT. FOREST - ERIADOR - DAY 44
CLOSE ON: RAIN THUNDERS DOWN on the Company. Every one of
them seems cold, wet and miserable.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo rides beside Gandalf, who seems unaffected
by this downpour.
[Gloin:]
Gandalf, can't you do something
about his deluge?
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 31.
44 CONTINUED: 44
[Gandalf:]
"It is raining, Master Dwarf, and it
will continue to rain until the
rain is done. If you wish to change
the weather of the world, you
should find yourself another
wizard."
CLOSE ON: Bilbo looks curious.
[Bilbo:]
Are there any?
[Gandalf:]
"What?"
[Bilbo:]
Other wizards?
[Gandalf:]
"There are five of us. The greatest
of our order is Saruman the White.
Then there are the two blue
wizards...
You know, I've quite forgotten
their names."
[Bilbo:]
And who is the fifth?
[Gandalf:]
"Well, that would be Radagast the
Brown."
[Bilbo:]
Is he a great wizard or is he more
like you?
Gandalf is slightly offended.
[Gandalf:]
"I think he is a very great wizard
in his own way. He's a gently soul
who prefers the company of animals
to others."
45 EXT. RHOSGOBEL - MIRKWOOD - DAY 45

THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 32.

[Gandalf:] (V.O.)
"He keeps a watchful eye to the vast
forest lands to the east, and a
good thing too, for always evil
will look to find a foothold in
this world."
Sunlight streams down onto the forest floor. A figure runs
through the forest, clutching a STAFF for support. RADAGAST
THE BROWN.
CLOSE ON: Radagast comes across a DYING PLANT, as black as
the night sky.
[Radagast:]
Not good! Not good at all!
ANGLE ON: Radagast darts towards his house. Many DEAD PLANTS
and ANIMAL litter the ground. He inspects the plants nearby,
MUSHROOMS, TREES and all.
He steps back from his work, distressed. Radagast gives a
WHISTLE, and a FLOCK OF BIRDS, come sailing down.
Radagast takes off his HAT, revealing a SMALL BIRD NEST on
his head. The birds clamber in and Radagast puts his hat
back on.
CLOSE ON: Something on the ground catches the wizard's eye.
GASPING, he rushes forward and picks it up. It is a
HEDGEHOG. Radagast cradles the dying creature, weeping.
[Radagast:] (CONT'D)
Sebastian! Good gracious!
ANGLE ON: Radagast takes off running towards an OVERGROWN
HOUSE.
46 INT. RHOSGOBEL - MIRKWOOD - DAY 46
Urgent, Radagast places Sebastian on the counter. He riffles
through this cabients, trying to cure the hedgehog with
VARIOUS TECHNIQUES. None work.
CLOSE ON: As he searches for remedies, MORE HEDGEHOGS
surround Sebastion, curious.
[Radagast:]
Move back! Give him some air, for
goodness sake!

THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 33.
46 CONTINUED: 46
The wizard continues his treatments, each one becoming more
desperate than the last. He steps back in frustration.
[Radagast:] (CONT'D)
I don't understand why it's not
working! It's not as if it's
witchcraft!
Suddenly, his face falls. Gravely serious, Radagast looks
down at Sebastian.
[Radagast:] (CONT'D)
Witchcraft. But it is; a dark and
powerful magic.
SCURRYING NOISES sound from outside.
ANGLE ON: Radagast looks, seeing the SHADOWS of several
GIANT SPIDERS crawling up the house. Panicked, Radagast bars
his door.
CLOSE ON: Sebastian CROAKS from the counter, GASPING for
air. Suddenly, he seizes up, dead. TEARS WELL in Radagast's
eyes.
The house begins to CREAK. The spiders are climbing onto the
roof.
ANGLE ON: Radagast turns to his staff and pulls out a BLUE
STONE from its top. He grabs Sebastian from the counter and
leans against a TREE TRUNK.
He begins to WHISPER A SPELL, holding the blue stone to
Sebastian's snout.
As Radagast chants, spiders begin to break the roof above.
PATCHES OF SUNLIGHT dot the floor as RUBBLE of the shattered
roof crumbles downward.
CLOSE ON: Radagast continues to chant, almost in a
TRANCE-LIKE STATE. As the spell grows more and more
powerful, a DARKNESS seems to fall over the house. A BLACK,
INKY SUBSTANCE begins to fill the blue stone, until -
ANGLE ON: Sebastian GASPS for air, alive. Radagast smiles
down at the creature as the darkness fades from the house.
From above, it sounds as if the spiders are crawling back
down the house.
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 34.
47 EXT. RHOSGOBEL - MIRKWOOD - DAY 47
Radagast runs outside. He catches a glimpse of a GIANT
SPIDER crawling off into the forest.
[Radagast:]
Where in this good earth did those
foul creatures come from?
A BIRD flies in beside him, TWITTERING. Radagast listens
intently, understanding the animal.
[Radagast:] (CONT'D)
The old fortress? Show me.
48 EXT. MIRKWOOD - DAY 48
A WOODEN SLEIGH bursts through the trees, pulled by SEVERAL
LARGE RABBITS. Radagast stands on the sleigh, holding onto
railings as he darts down the forest track.
WIDE ON: In the distance, an OLD, RUINED FORTRESS towers
above the trees. DOL GULDUR.
49 EXT. ABANDONED FARMHOUSE - TROLLSHAWS - DAY 49
WIDE ON: The Company approaches a RUINED FARMHOUSE. Thorin
scans the area, before turning to the others.
[Thorin:]
We'll camp here for the night.
Fili, Kili, look after the ponies.
Make sure you stay with them.
The group begins to dismount.
ANGLE ON: Gandalf wanders into the farmhouse, examining the
ruin.
[Gandalf:]
"A farmer and his family used to
live here."
From outside, Thorin turns to Oin and Gloin.
[Thorin:]
Oin, Gloin, get a fire going.
[Gloin:]
Right you are.
Gloin nods in agreement, leading his brother into the woods.
Gandalf locks eyes with Thorin as he enters the farmhouse.

[Gandalf:]
"I think it would be wiser to move
on. We could make for the Hidden
Valley."
[Thorin:]
I have told you already, I will not
go near that place.
[Gandalf:]
"Why not? The elves could help us!
We could get food, rest, advice."
[Thorin:]
I do not need their advice.
[Gandalf:]
"We have a map we cannot read; Lord
Elrond will help us."
[Thorin:]
Help? A dragon attacks Erebor, what
help came from the elves? Orcs
plunder Moria, desecrate our sacred
halls, and the elves looked on and
did nothing. You ask me to seek out
the very people who betrayed my
grandfather and betrayed my father?
[Gandalf:]
"You are neither of them. And
besides, it was not Lord Elrond who
abandoned you at Erebor. That blame
lies with King Thranduil of the
Woodland Realm. I did not give you
that map and key for you to hold
onto the past."
[Thorin:]
I did not know they were yours to
keep.
Gandalf scowls at Thorin and stops away. He passes Bilbo,
tending to the horses. Bilbo seems confused.
[Bilbo:]
Everything all right? Gandalf,
where are you going?

around here who's got any sense."
[Bilbo:]
And who's that?
[Gandalf:]
"Myself, Mr. Baggins! I've had
enough of dwarves for one day."
Thorin steps out of the farmhouse, glowering after Gandalf.
[Thorin:]
Come on, Dwalin, we're hungry.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo turns to Balin.
[Bilbo:]
Is he coming back?
Balin looks uncertain.
50 EXT. ABANDONED FARMHOUSE - TROLLSHAWS - NIGHT 50
CLOSE ON: Dwalin stands near the fire, POURING SOUP into TWO
BOWLS. Bilbo is on lookout, visibly worried.
[Bilbo:]
He's been a long time.
[Dwalin:]
Who?
[Bilbo:]
Gandalf!
[Dwalin:]
He's a wizard, he does as he
chooses.
(hands Bilbo the bowls)
Here, do us a favor: take these to
the lads.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo carefully takes the bowls and makes for the
forest.
51 EXT. WOODS - TROLLSHAWS - NIGHT 51

[Bilbo:]
What's the matter?
[Kili:]
We're supposed to be looking after
the ponies.
[Fili:]
Only, we've encountered a slight
problem.
[Kili:]
We had sixteen. Now there's
fourteen.
ANGLE ON: The PONIES mill about in their pens. Two are
missing.
52 EXT. WOODS - TROLLSHAWS - NIGHT - LATER 52
WIDE ON: Fili and Kili examine the horses in their pens.
Bilbo follows behind them, clutching the wooden bowls.
[Kili:]
Daisy and Bungo are missing.
[Bilbo:]
Well, that's not good. That is not
good at all. Shouldn't we tell
Thorin?
[Fili:]
No, let's not worry him. As our
official burglar, we thought that
you might like to look into it.
Bilbo looks around, seeing several UPROOTED TREES.
[Bilbo:]
Well, something big uprooted these
trees.
[Fili:]
That was our thinking.
[Bilbo:]
Something very big and possibly
quite dangerous.

ANGLE ON: Suddenly, Fili crouches behind one of the uprooted
trees. He points deeper into the woods.
[Fili:]
(whispering)
Hey, there's a light.
Fili beckons the other two forward.
[Fili:] (CONT'D)
Over here. Stay down.
The three rush forward and take cover behind a LOG, spying
on the FLICKERING LIGHT.
HARSH LAUGHTER sounds from near the fire.
[Bilbo:]
What is it?
[Kili:]
Trolls.
Fili and Kili run closer to the fire. Bilbo runs after them,
still gripping onto their meals.
THUNDER FOOTSTEPS come from nearby. Quickly, the trio takes
cover behind an aging oak tree.
They are all alarmed to see a massive Mountain Troll,
[William:], walk towards the fire. He holds TWO MORE PONIES at
his side.
[Bilbo:]
(whispering)
He's got Myrtle and Minty! I think
they're going to eat them, we have
to do something.
[Fili:]
Yes, you should. Mountain trolls
are slow and stupid, and you're so
small.
[Bilbo:]
No!
[Fili:]
It's perfectly safe; we'll be right
behind you.

Fili pushes Bilbo forward, taking the bowls from him.
[Kili:]
If you run into trouble, hoot twice
like a barn owl, once like a brown
owl.
Bilbo walks forward in reluctance.
[Bilbo:]
Twice like a barn owl, once like a
brown owl? Are you sure this is a
good idea?
WIDE ON: He turns around, but Fili and Kili are already out
of site. With a SIGH, Bilbo trudges forward.
53 EXT. TROLL LAIR - TROLLSHAWS - NIGHT 53
Two trolls, BERT and TOM sit around a fire. Bert STIRS the
contents of a CAULDRON dangling above the flames. Tom
watches him with a hungry stare.
William enters the lair. He carries the two ponies into a
makeshift pen, locking them inside.
[Bert:]
Mutton yesterday, mutton today and
blimey, if it don't look like
mutton again tomorrow.
[William:]
Quite your gripping. These ain't
sheep; these is West Nags!
[Tom:]
I don't like horse, I never have.
Not enough fat on them.
[Bert:]
Well, it's better than that
leathery old farmer. All skin and
bones, he was. I'm still picking
bits of him out of me teeth.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo sneaks around the campsite, hiding behind
trees and bushes.

SNEEZES into the cauldron.

There's more where that came from!
Tom begins to sneeze again, but Bert grabs him by the nose.
Bert forces Tom down.
[Bert:]
Sit down!
ANGLE ON: Bilbo takes advantage of this scuffle, and dashes
towards the pens.
WIDE ON: WHIMPERING, Tom pulls out his HANDKERCHIEF and
blows.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo turns and sees that the troll is wearing a
LONG KNIFE in his belt. The hobbit creeps forward, eyes set
on the blade.
[William:]
I'm starving! Are we having horse
tonight or what?
[Bert:]
Shut your cakehole. You'll eat what
I give you!
[William:]
How come he's the cook? Everything
tastes the same; everything tastes
like chicken.

Except the chicken.

Bert passes the ladle to Tom, who puts his handkerchief back
over the knife.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo stands behind the troll. He carefully
reaches for the knife.
[William:]
Me guts are grumbling. I've got to
snaffle something. Flesh! I need
flesh!
Bilbo's fingers brush against Tom's knife - so close!
Suddenly, Tom reaches for his handkerchief. Instead, the
troll grabs Bilbo, SPRAYING SNOT all over him. Tom peers
down at the hobbit, taken aback.
[Tom:]
Blimey! Bert, look what's come out
of me hooter! It's got arms and
legs and everything.
The other trolls gather around, staring at Bilbo in
amazement.
[William:]
What is it?
[Tom:]
I don't know, but I don't like the
way it wriggles around.
Tom shakes Bilbo to the ground. Slowly, he gets back on his
feet. William stands above Bilbo, pointing a JAGGED ROCK
down at him.
[William:]
What are you then, an oversized
squirrel?
[Bilbo:]
I'm a burgl- a hobbit!
[Tom:]
A Burgla-Hobbit?
[William:]
Can we cook him?
[Tom:]
We can try!
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 42.
53 CONTINUED: (3) 53
WIDE ON: Tom tries to grab Bilbo, but he dodges. Bilbo
sprints toward the trees. Toward an escape. However, Bert
corners him.
[Bert:]
He wouldn't make more than a
mouthful, not when he's skinned and
boned!
[William:]
Perhaps there's more Burgla-Hobbits
around these parts. Might be enough
for a pie!
All of the trolls try to grab Bilbo, but he outruns them at
every turn.
[Tom:]
It's too quick!
Bilbo runs through Tom's leg as Bert swings his ladle,
aiming for Bilbo. He hits Tom's knee instead, making the
troll YELP out in pain.
ANGLE ON: Finally, William grabs a hold of Bilbo, and
dangles him upside down.
[William:]
Are there any more of you little
fellows hiding where you shouldn't?
[Bilbo:]
No.
[Tom:]
He's lying.
[Bilbo:]
No, I'm not!
[Tom:]
Hang his toes over the fire! Make
him squeal!
Kili emerges from out of the bushes. He hacks Tom's leg,
sending the troll SQUEALING. The other trolls look down at
Kili, startled.
[Kili:]
Drop him!
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 43.
53 CONTINUED: (4) 53
[William:]
You what?
[Kili:]
I said, drop him.
GROWLING, William throws Bilbo on top of Kili. The other
dwarves charge out of the treeline, weapons drawn.
Bravely, they fight against the trolls, HACKING and
HAMMERING. As the battle rages on, Bilbo creeps beneath the
trolls' feet, dodging every footfall.
Tom's knife falls from his belt as Fili and Kili hammer down
on his toes. Bilbo sneaks over, grabbing the weapon and
darting over to the pens.
Bilbo cuts the ponies free, sending them running in every
direction. From across the clearing, William sees him. The
troll lumbers over, grabbing Bilbo by his arms and legs.
Seeing Bilbo, the dwarves freeze in place.
[Fili:]
Bilbo!
[William:]
Lay down your arms, or we'll rip
his off!
Thorin looks up at Bilbo, conflicted. Finally, he throws his
sword onto the ground, almost in reluctance. The others
follow suit, dropping their swords and axes by their sides.
54 EXT. TROLL LAIR - TROLLSHAWS - NIGHT - LATER 54
William throws SEVERAL LOGS onto the fire. Dwalin, Fili, Oin
and Gloin have all been tied to a spit, GROANING and
PROTESTING. The others are tied up in sacks nearby.
Bert tends to the spit, spinning it back and forth. Tom
approaches him.
[Tom:]
Don't bother cooking them. Let's
just sit on them and squash them
into jelly.
[Bert:]
They should be sauteed and grilled
with a sprinkle of sage.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 44.
54 CONTINUED: 54
[Tom:]
Well, that does sound quite nice.
[William:]
Never mind the seasoning; we ain't
got all night! Dawn ain't far away
and I don't fancy being turned to
stone.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo's face LIGHTS UP. He has an idea.
[Bilbo:]
Wait! You are making a terrible
mistake!
[Gloin:]
You can't reason with them, they're
half-wits.
[Fili:]
Half-wits? What does that make us?
[Bilbo:]
(to the Trolls)
I meant with the seasoning.
WIDE ON: Although still tied up, Bilbo manages to jump to
his feet.
[Bert:]
What about the seasoning?
[Bilbo:]
Well, have you smelt them? You're
going to need something stronger
than sage before you plate this lot
up.
The dwarves YELL IN PROTEST.
[William:]
What do you know about cooking
dwarf?
[Bert:]
Shut up and let the
flurgaburburrhobbit talk.
[Bilbo:]
Yes, well, the secret to cooking
dwarf is -

[Bert:]
Yes? Come on!
[Bilbo:]
It's -
[Bert:]
Tell us the secret.
[Bilbo:]
Yes, I'm telling you, the secret is
to skin them first!
The dwarves ROAR in their rage. A grin spreads over Bert's
face.
[Bert:]
Tom, get me filleting knife.
[William:]
What a load of rubbish! I've eaten
plenty with their skins on. Scruff
them, I say, boots and all.
ANGLE ON: Suddenly, Bilbo spots Gandalf slipping behind some
trees. The wizard appears on a LARGE ROCK above them. A
powerful rage seems to posses the wizard.
[Gandalf:]
"The dawn will take you all!"
CLOSE ON: Confused, the trolls turn to Gandalf.
[Bert:]
Who's that?
[William:]
No idea.
[Tom:]
Can we eat him too?
ANGLE ON: Gandalf strikes the rock beneath him with his
staff. It breaks in half with a CRACK. Sunlight pours into
the clearing.
The light touches the troll's skin, TURNING THEM INTO STONE
as they SCREAM AND HOWL. Within seconds, the trolls are
nothing more than STATUES.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 46.
54 CONTINUED: (3) 54
CLOSE ON: In their joy, the dwarves CHEER LOUDLY. Dwalin
GROANS from the spit.
[Dwalin:]
Oh, get your foot out of my back!
55 EXT. TROLL LAIR - TROLLSHAWS - DAY 55
WIDE ON: The dwarves help free one another from the sacks,
HEAVING as they push and pull.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf walks by one of the stone trolls and
THUMPS it's head with his staff, smiling. Thorin approaches
Gandalf.
[Thorin:]
Where did you go to, if I may ask?
[Gandalf:]
"To look ahead."
[Thorin:]
What brought you back?
[Gandalf:]
"Looking behind. Nasty business;
still, they're all in one piece."
[Thorin:]
No thanks to your burglar.
[Gandalf:]
"He had the nous to play for time.
None of the rest of you thought of
that."
Thorin looks repentant. Gandalf turns, examining the trolls.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
"They must have come down from the
Ettenmoors."
[Thorin:]
Since when do mountain trolls
venture this far south?
[Gandalf:]
"Oh, not for an age. Not since a
darker power ruled these lands. In
any case, they could not have moved
in daylight."
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 47.
55 CONTINUED: 55
[Thorin:]
There must be a cave nearby.
Thorin and Gandalf scan the surrounding area.
56 INT. TROLL HOARD - TROLLSHAWS - DAY 56
WIDE ON: Gandalf leads the Company down a DARK CAVE. As they
enter, the dwarves begin to COUGH AND RETCH at the smell.
[Kili:]
What's that stench?
[Gandalf:]
"It's a troll hoard. Be careful what
you touch."
ANGLE ON: The Company finds PILES OF GOLD COINS and OTHER
TREASURES in caskets. Fili approaches the coins scattered
about the ground.
[Fili:]
Seems a shame to leave it lying
around. Anyone could take it.
[Gloin:]
Agreed. Oin, get a shovel.
Thorin inspects TWO SWORDS covered in cobwebs. He hands one
to Gandalf, unsheathing them. He looks in wonder at the
steel.
[Thorin:]
These were not made by any troll.
[Gandalf:]
"Nor were they made by any smith
among men."
Gandalf looks closer at the markings on the blade.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
"These were forged in Gondolin by
the High Elves of the First Age."
Thorin begins to put the sword away in disgust. Gandalf
glares over at him.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
"You could not wish for a finer
blade!"
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 48.
56 CONTINUED: 56
Reluctantly, Thorin unsheathes the sword, holding it high
above him.
Near the entrance of the cave, other dwarves fill ONE CHEST
with the coins, burying it in a hole in the ground.
CLOSE ON: Dwalin shakes his head as he watches them.
[Gloin:]
We're making a long term deposit!
ANGLE ON: Thorin walks past them, his new sword tied to his
belt.
[Thorin:]
Come! Let's get out of this foul
place.
The dwarves file behind Thorin, leaving the cave. Gandalf
makes to follow them, when his foot hits against something
METALLIC.
CLOSE ON: With the edge of his staff, Gandalf brushes away
some leaves. A SMALL SWORD, wrapped neatly in its sheath,
lies in the dirt below.
57 EXT. TROLLSHAWS - DAY 57
WIDE ON: Near the mouth of the cave, the dwarves are tending
to their horses. Gandalf emerges from the troll hoard and
approaches Bilbo.
[Gandalf:]
"Bilbo, here. This is about your
size."
CLOSE ON: Gandalf hands it to Bilbo. He looks at the weapon,
hesitant.
[Bilbo:]
I can't take this.
[Gandalf:]
"The blade is of Elvish make, which
means it will glow blue when orcs
or goblins are nearby."
[Bilbo:]
I have never used a sword in my
life.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 49.
57 CONTINUED: 57
[Gandalf:]
"And I hope you'll never have to.
But if you do, remember this: true
courage is about knowing not when
to take a life, but when to spare
one."
Suddenly, LOUD RUSTLING comes from deep within the forest.
[Thorin:]
Something's coming!
Gandalf withdraws his sword, running to the dwarves.
[Gandalf:]
"Stay together! Hurry now, arm
yourselves."
Bilbo lingers behind. Slowly, he draws out the sword,
looking in wonder at the weapon's power. He turns, and runs
to join the others.
58 EXT. CLEARING - TROLLSHAWS - DAY 58
Riding at full speed through the trees, RADAGAST THE BROWN,
is led by a RABBIT-DRAWN SLED. He bursts through the woods,
startling the Company.
[Radagast:]
Thieves! Fire! Murder!
ANGLE ON: Radagast draws to a halt. The dwarves all have
their weapons withdrawn. They look to Gandalf for an
explanation of this odd sight.
[Gandalf:]
"Radagast! It's Radagast the Brown."
WIDE ON: Gandalf walks towards his fellow wizard. He seems
glad with this new arrival.
59 EXT. CLEARING - TROLLSHAWS - DAY - LATER 59
Gandalf smokes on his pipe with a grave expression. He and
Radagast have gone off several paces from the dwarves.
[Radagast:]
The Greenwood is sick, Gandalf. A
darkness has fallen over it.
Nothing grows anymore, at least
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 50.
59 CONTINUED: 59
[Radagast:] (cont'd)
nothing good. The air is foul with
decay. But worse are the webs.
[Gandalf:]
"Webs? What do you mean?"
[Radagast:]
Spiders, Gandalf. Giant ones. Some
kind of spawn of Ungoliant, or I am
not a wizard. I followed their
trail. They came from Dol Guldur.
[Gandalf:]
"Dol Guldur? But the old fortress is
abandoned."
[Radagast:]
No, Gandalf, it is not.
CUT TO:
60 EXT. DOL GULDUR - DAY (FLASHBACK) 60
Radagast crosses a stone bridge and enters a DARK RUINED
FORTRESS, his STAFF at the ready.
[Radagast:] (V.O.)
A dark power dwells in there, such
as I have never felt before. It is
the shadow of an ancient horror.
One that can summon the spirits of
the dead.
ANGLE ON: He walks through the seemingly abandoned fortress.
Radagast seems panicked and afraid, clutching his staff with
shaking hands.
Near a HOODED STATUE, Radagast spies a gleam of steel. A
SWORD. He picks it up, looking stunned as he examines the
weapon.
[Radagast:] (V.O.)(CONT'D)
I saw him, Gandalf, from out of the
dark. A Necromancer has come.
Radagast turns, seeing the black shadow of THE NECROMANCER
standing in a near tunnel. It WHISPERS a haunting and
dangerous sounding CHANT.
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 51.
61 EXT. CLEARING - TROLLSHAWS - DAY 61
CLOSE ON: Radagast jumps in fright, recalling the memory. He
looks at Gandalf in an awkward apology.
[Radagast:]
Sorry.
[Gandalf:]
"Now, a Necromancer? Are you sure?"
ANGLE ON: From his robes, Radagast pulls out a NARROW, CLOTH
WRAPPED PACKAGE. Gandalf unties it and looks inside. He
looks up, concerned.
[Radagast:]
That is not from the world of the
living.
From the distance, WOLVES HOWL. The dwarves perk up in
alarm.
[Bilbo:]
Was that a wolf? Are there wolves
out there?
[Fili:]
Wolf? No, that is not a wolf.
From behind a nearby crag, a WARG appears. It leaps into the
midst of the Company, savage and ferocious. Thorin buries
his sword into it's neck, killing it.
Another charges from behind. Kili draws an arrow, shooting
down the beast. It attempts to pick itself back up, but
Dwalin brings his hammer down upon it. The warg dies with a
WHIMPER.
[Thorin:]
Warg scouts! Which means an Orc
pack is not far behind.
[Bilbo:]
Orc pack?
[Gandalf:]
"Who did you tell about your quest,
beyond your kin."
[Thorin:]
No one.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 52.
61 CONTINUED: 61
[Gandalf:]
"Who did you tell?"
[Thorin:]
No one, I swear. What in Durin's
name is going on?
[Gandalf:]
"You are being hunted!"
[Dwalin:]
We have to get out of here.
WIDE ON: Gloin appears from the crest of the hill.
[Gloin:]
We can't! We have no ponies,
they've bolted!
[Radagast:]
I'll draw them off.
[Gandalf:]
"These are Gundabad Wargs, they will
outrun you!"
Radagast points to his RABBITS.
[Radagast:]
These are Rhosgobel rabbits! I'd
like to see them try.
CLOSE ON: A wide, toothy grin splits across the wizard's
face. The HOWLING OF WARGS echo across the forest.
62 EXT. FORDS - ERIADOR - DAY 62
CRANE SHOT: WARG SCOUTS search the outskirts of the woods,
led by their commander, YAZNEG. Everything is DEATHLY
SILENT, until -
Radagast shoots out of the trees, mounted on his rabbit-led
sleigh.
[Radagast:]
Come and get me!
Yazneg leads his riders after Radagast, BARKING COMMANDS.
ANGLE ON: Further along the field, Gandalf watches from
behind a LARGE BOULDER. Radagast and the pursuing orcs

62 CONTINUED: 62
disappear into the distance.
[Gandalf:]
"Come on."
TRACKING SHOT: Gandalf runs forward, the Company TRAILING
BEHIND HIM. Together, the nine of them dart across the rocky
plain, weapons drawn. Radagast and the orcs can be seen in
the distance.
WIDE ON: Radagast leads the orcs away, his face contorted in
determination. The Company continues to weave in and out of
the rocks, led by Thorin and Gandalf.
ANGLE ON: Suddenly, Thorin stops in his tracks. Radagast and
the orcs run past them, too close for comfort. Gandalf looks
to Bilbo and the dwarves.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
"Stay together."
He turns around, leading the dwarves back into the barren
fields. The dwarves stop behind another boulder. OUT OF
BREATH and DISORIENTATED, Balin continue to jog forward.
[Thorin:]
Balin, no!
Thorin grabs him by the collar and pulls Balin behind the
rock. Gandalf watches Radagast closely, waiting for the
right moment.
Finally, Gandalf beckons the dwarves to run. Thorin stays
behind with Gandalf, briefly.
[Thorin:] (CONT'D)
Where are you leading us?
Gandalf does not answer. Discontent, Thorin rejoins with the
dwarves.
CLOSE ON: Yazneg and his orcs continue to chase after
Radagast, their MAKESHIFT SWORDS drawn high in the air. One
orc abruptly comes to a stop. He SMELLS THE AIR. The orc
observes the rocky ford in suspicion.
ANGLE ON: The Company is quick to spot this. They dive
behind an outcropping rock, their breath ragged.
CLOSE ON: The orc, still mounted on top of the warg, climbs
the boulder. He takes another good whiff of the air.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 54.
62 CONTINUED: (2) 62
The dwarves are silent. Thorin looks at Kili and nods.
Slowly, he readies his bow and arrow.
ANGLE ON: Suddenly, Kili springs out from behind the rock.
The orc is quick to grab for his HORN, but Kili looses his
arrow. Both the orc and his warg are shot off of the boulder
and onto the ground.
WIDE ON: From across the ford, Yazneg and the others come to
a halt. GROWLS and SCREECHES echo across the plains.
ANGLE ON: Wounded, the orc rises to his feet again. Dwalin
leaps forward, sending his warhammer crashing down onto the
orc. He dies with a WHIMPER.
Yazneg raises his sword in the air, watching the dwarves
from across the ford.
YAZENG
(in Black Speech;
subtitled)
The Dwarf-scum are over there!
After them!
CRANE SHOT: The Warg Riders change their course to the
dwarves.
ANGLE ON: The Company hears the WARGS HOWLING. Bilbo and the
dwarves are panic-stricken.
[Gandalf:]
"Move. Run!"
Gandalf leads the Company forward. They sprint past rocks,
boulders, bushes and trees. In the distance, the orcs are
coming closer and closer.
The dwarves continue to flee from the scouts, until -
Yazneg emerges from the crest of the hill. Other orcs files
beside their commander, circling around the Company.
[Kili:]
They're coming!
[Thorin:]
Kili, shoot them! Shoot them down!
Gandalf sees an entrance to an UNDERGROUND CAVERN. One
moment, he is running towards it, and the next moment, he is
gone.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 55.
62 CONTINUED: (3) 62
Slowly, the orcs and the wargs march forward. They are
closing in on their prey.
[Fili:]
We're surrounded!
Kili begins loading and unloading arrows as best he can,
taking out an orc here and there.
[Kili:]
Where is Gandalf?
[Dwalin:]
Has he abandoned us?
CLOSE ON: Yazneg approaches the company, riding atop his
warg. He SNARLS VICIOUSLY, giving the Company a deathly
stare. Thorin draws out Orcrist, which GLOWS BLUE.
[Thorin:]
Hold your ground!
ANGLE ON: The dwarves circle up, their weapons raised.
Yazneg rides closer, glaring all the while. The Company
stares back at him, defiant.
Suddenly, Gandalf pops out from the cavern entrance.
[Gandalf:]
"This way, you fools!"
[Thorin:]
All of you, go, go!
Bilbo and the dwarves dash towards the cavern entrance. One
by one, they start to SLIDE UNDERGROUND. Seeing this, Yazneg
sends his wargs forward.
As the Company slides into the cavern, Thorin slices the
wargs down. He turns to Kili, still shooting in the field.
[Thorin:] (CONT'D)
Kili!
Reluctant, Kili runs forward. He slides into the cavern,
with Thorin filing in behind him.
63 INT. CAVERN - ERIADOR - DAY 63
The dwarves catch their breath in the cavern. Dwalin
investigates an exit in the cave wall. From outside, ELVISH

HORNS RING OUT in the distance.
64 EXT. FORDS - ERIADOR - DAY 64
WIDE ON: A DOZEN MOUNTED ELVES charge forward in full force.
Arrows fly in every direction, bringing down orcs and wargs
alike.
CLOSE ON: Yazneg ROARS IN DEFEAT. An orc is shot down from
his warg. His corpse rolls down the fords, reaching the
cavern entrance.
65 INT. CAVERN - ERIADOR - DAY 65
ANGLE ON: The dead orc rolls into the cavern, an arrow
buried into his head. Thorin plucks out the arrow, examining
its make.
[Thorin:]
Elves.
Thorin drops it in disgust. Dwalin emerges from the crack in
the cave wall.
[Dwalin:]
I cannot see where the pathway
leads. Do we follow it or no?
[Fili:]
Follow it, of course!
The dwarves shuffle forward.
[Gandalf:]
"I think that would be wise."
CLOSE ON: Gandalf grins to himself. He knows something.
Bilbo looks at him, suspicious.
66 INT. HIDDEN PASS - ERIADOR - DAY 66
CLOSE ON: Dwalin leads the dwarves through the NARROW GAP in
the cavern. The Company GROANS they push the path.
HIGH ANGLE: Sunlight beams down on the dwarves. They squeeze
through the twisting cliffs, each step becoming more and
more strenuous.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo looks around to Gandalf, bewildered.

Gandalf, where are we?

"You can feel it?"
[Bilbo:]
Yes. It feels like - well, like
magic.
[Gandalf:]
"That's exactly what it is. A very
powerful magic."
[Dwalin:]
There is light ahead!
Gandalf steps forward with the dwarves. Bilbo looks at him
suspicious.
67 EXT. RIVENDELL OUTSKIRTS - DAY 67
ANGLE ON: The dwarves push through the final stretch of the
pathway. The Company stops at a ridge, looking below them.
WIDE ON: They see a valley gleaming in golden sunlight.
RIVENDELL.
[Gandalf:]
"The Valley of Imraldis. In the
Common Tongue, it's known by
another name."
[Bilbo:]
Rivendell.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo is amazed. The dwarves, on the other hand,
are extremely displeased.
[Gandalf:]
"Here lies the last homely house
east of the sea."
ANGLE ON: Thorin wheels around and glares at Gandalf.
[Thorin:]
This was your plan all along, to
seek refuge with our enemy.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 58.
67 CONTINUED: 67
[Gandalf:]
"You have no enemies here, Thorin
Oakenshield. The only ill-will to
be found in this valley is that
which you bring yourself."
[Thorin:]
You think the elves will give our
quest their blessing? They will try
to stop us.
[Gandalf:]
"Of course they will. But we have
questions that need to be answered.
If we are to be successful, this
will need to be handled with tact
and respect and no small degree of
charm, which is why you will leave
the talking to me."
WIDE ON: Gandalf begins to make his way down the hill and
into the valley. The dwarves reluctantly follow suit.
68 EXT. COURTYARD - RIVENDELL - DAY 68
ANGLE ON: The Company enters the main courtyard of
Rivendell. The entire place seems to be suspended in an
eternal state of tranquility. Bilbo looks around him, awed
by Rivendell's majesty.
A dark-haired elf, LINDIR, walks down a flight of stairs
nearby. He gives Gandalf a courteous smile.
LINDIR
Mithrandir.
[Gandalf:]
"Ah, Lindir!"
As the two greet one another, the dwarves MURMUR IN
DISTRUST.
LINDIR
(in Elvish; subtitled)
We heard you had crossed into the
Valley.

"I must speak with Lord Elrond."

LINDIR
My lord Elrond is not here.
[Gandalf:]
"Not here? Where is he?"
Suddenly, ELVISH HORNS RING OUT across the courtyard. The
Company turns. ARMED HORSEMAN approach the Company at a
rapid rate. The dwarves raise their weapons, defensive.
Elves ride into courtyard, looking down at the dwarves in
confusion. They circle around the Company, banners caught
high in the breeze. Slowly the elves come to a halt.
CLOSE ON: Their leader, ELROND, separates himself from the
others.
[Elrond:]
Gandalf.
The wizard bows gracefully.
[Gandalf:]
"Lord Elrond.
My friend! Where have you been."
[Elrond:]
We've been hunting a pack of orcs
that came up from the south. We
slew a number near the hidden pass.
ANGLE ON: Elrond dismounts from his horse, where he and
Gandalf embrace. After they part, Elrond begins to tend to
his armor.
[Elrond:] (CONT'D)
Strange for Orcs to come so close
to our borders. Something, or
someone has drawn them near.
[Gandalf:]
"That may have been us."
CLOSE ON: Thorin steps forward. Elrond looks upon him with
recognition.
[Elrond:]
Welcome Thorin, son of Thrain.

[Thorin:]
I do not believe we have met.
[Elrond:]
You have your grandfather's
bearing. I knew Thror when he ruled
under the Mountain.
[Thorin:]
Indeed; he made no mention of you.
Ignoring this insult, Elrond looks to all the dwarves. He
begins to SPEAK IN ELVISH.
[Elrond:]
(In Elvish)
Light the fires, bring forth the
wine. We must feed our guests.
The dwarves grow bellicose and GRIP THEIR WEAPONS UNEASILY.
Gloin jumps forward, raising up his AXE.
[Gloin:]
What is he saying? Does he offer us
insult?
Gandalf steps forward, stern.
[Gandalf:]
"No, master Gloin, he's offering you
food."
The dwarves circle up, discussing with one another in LOW
WHISPERS. Gloin turns back to Elrond, disgruntled.
[Gloin:]
Well, in that case, lead on.
ANGLE ON: The elf gives a curt nod and strides up the
stairs. The dwarves follow behind him, uneasy.
69 EXT. ELVEN COURT - RIVENDELL - DAY 69
ANGLE ON: The dwarves sit around a table, OVERFLOWING WITH
FOOD. However, the dwarves pick at the meal, uninterested.
[Dwalin:]
Where's the meat?
CLOSE ON: Oin holds up a VEGETABLE with his knife, looking

[Oin:]
Have they got any chips.
ANGLE ON: Elrond and Gandalf enter the court, walking past
and ELF MAIDEN playing the HARP.
[Gandalf:]
"Kind of you to invite us. I'm not
really dressed for dinner."
[Elrond:]
Well, you never are.
They both CHUCKLE, and sit themselves at the head of the
table.
CLOSE ON: From the end of the table, Kili and the elf maid
exchange looks. Kili gives her a WINK.
Kili turns, noticing the other dwarves staring at him. He
SHRUGS.
[Kili:]
I can't say I fancy elf maids
myself. To thin. They're all high
cheekbones and creamy skin. Not
enough facial hair for me.
Although, that one there's not bad.
He cocks his head at a passing elf.
[Dwalin:]
That's not an elf maid.
Kili looks as the elf turns, revealing himself to be no elf
maid.
Shocked, Kili looks to the other dwarves. They ROAR WITH
LAUGHTER, banging against the table in their amusement.
[Kili:]
It's funny.
Kili awkwardly picks at his food. Another elf maid passes
the table, playing the FLUTE. Oin stuffs a NAPKIN into his
hearing trumpet, blocking out the music.
ANGLE ON: Elrond holds out Thorin's sword. He carefully
examines it, running his hand up and down the sheath.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 62.
69 CONTINUED: (2) 69
[Elrond:]
This is Orcrist, the Goblin
Cleaver. A famous blade, forged by
the High Elves of the West. My kin.
May it serve you well.
He hands Orcrist back to Thorin, who accepts with a nod.
Elrond turns now to Gandalf's sword. He slides the sword
several inches out of its sheath.
[Elrond:] (CONT'D)
And this is Glamdring, the
Foe-hammer, sword of the King of
Gondolin. These swords were made
for the goblin wars of the First
Age.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo looks down at his own small sword underneath
the table. Balin gives him a pitying smile.
[Balin:]
I wouldn't bother, laddie. Swords
are named for the great deeds they
do in war.
[Bilbo:]
What are you saying, my sword
hasn't seen battle?
[Balin:]
I'm not actually sure it is a
sword; more of a letter opener,
really.
ANGLE ON: Elrond returns Glamdring to Gandalf. Elrond has an
inquiring look about him.
[Elrond:]
How did you come by these?
[Gandalf:]
"We found them in a troll hoard on
the Great East Road, shorty before
we were ambushed by orcs."
[Elrond:]
And what were you doing on the
Great East Road?
No one answers. Thorin, looking perturbed, rises.

[Thorin:]
Excuse me.
Thorin is quick to leave the court. Gandalf and Elrond
exchange looks.
70 INT. NARSIL CHAMBER - RIVENDELL - DAY 70
Gold morning light streams into the chamber. Bilbo
approaches the SHARDS OF NARSIL, held by a great stone
statue.
He gives the sword a brief look, before turning his
attention to the MURAL OF DAGORLAD. SAURON looms above
ISSILDUR, his BLACK MACE raised high in the air.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo looks at the painting in wonder. His
attention is particularly taken by the GOLD RING around
Sauron's finger. THE ONE RING.
71 EXT. COURTYARD - RIVENDELL - DAY 71
WIDE ON: Bilbo wanders through the courtyard, a peaceful
smile on his face. He stares in admiration at the beauty of
Rivendell, and all its many houses.
CLOSE ON: BIRDS TWITTER past Bilbo. He SIGHS DEEPLY.
72 EXT. BALCONY - RIVENDELL - DAY 72
ANGLE ON: Bilbo stands at the edge of a balcony, looking
down at the rivers and streams below.
Elrond enters the balcony. He strides towards Bilbo and
comes to a stop beside him.
[Elrond:]
Not with your companions?
[Bilbo:]
No, I shan't be missed. The truth
is that most of them don't think I
should be on this journey.
[Elrond:]
Indeed? I've heard that hobbits are
very resilient.
[Bilbo:]
Really?
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 64.
72 CONTINUED: 72
CLOSE ON: Elrond nods.
[Elrond:]
I've also heard they're fond of the
comforts of home.
[Bilbo:]
I've heard that it is unwise to
seek the council of elves, for they
will answer with yes and no.
Elrond looks down at Bilbo, giving him a warm smile. The
hobbit makes a NERVOUS CHUCKLE.
[Elrond:]
You are always welcome to stay
here, if that is your wish.
He turns and leaves the balcony. Bilbo stares after him,
considerate.
73 INT. ELROND'S CHAMBERS - RIVENDELL - NIGHT 73
ANGLE ON: Gandalf, Thorin, Bilbo and Balin are gathered in
Elrond's chambers. Thorin stares at Elrond, nothing but PURE
RESENTMENT in his eyes.
[Thorin:]
Our business is no concern of
elves.
[Gandalf:]
"For goodness sake, Thorin, show him
the map."
[Thorin:]
It is the legacy of my people; it
is mine to protect, as are its
secrets.
[Gandalf:]
"Save me from the stubbornness of
dwarves. Your pride will be your
downfall. You stand here in the
presence of one of the few in
Middle Earth who can read that map.
Show it to Lord Elrond!"
Everyone looks to Thorin, waiting. Reluctantly, he draws the
map out of his coat.

73 CONTINUED: 73
[Balin:]
Thorin, no!
Balin holds out his hand, but Thorin brushes him aside.
Thorin hands Elrond the map.
[Elrond:]
Erebor. What is your interest in
this map?
CLOSE ON: Thorin opens his mouth to speak, but Gandalf
answers first.
[Gandalf:]
"It's mainly academic. As you know,
this sort of artifact sometimes
contains hidden text. You still
read ancient dwarvish, do you not?"
Elrond walks several paces off, into the moonlight. The map
is bathed in PEARLY WHITE LIGHT.
[Elrond:]
(in Elvish)
Moon runes.
[Gandalf:]
"Moon runes? Of course; an easy
thing to miss."
[Elrond:]
Well, in this case, that is true;
moon runes can only be read by the
light of a moon the same shape and
season as the day on which they
were written.
[Thorin:]
Can you read them?
ANGLE ON: Elrond nods. He walks out of the chambers, Gandalf
and the others following behind.
74 EXT. CLIFFSIDE - RIVENDELL - NIGHT 74
WIDE ON: The group enters an open area on the side of a
cliff. Waterfalls rush on every side, ROARING DEAFENINGLY.
Elrond lies the map on a LARGE CRYSTALLINE TABLE.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 66.
74 CONTINUED: 74
[Elrond:]
These runes were written on a
Midsummer's Eve by the light of a
crescent moon nearly two hundred
years ago. It would seem you were
meant to come to Rivendell. Fate is
with you, Thorin Oakenshield; the
same moon shines upon us tonight.
CLOSE ON: They look up. Clouds pass over the moon, shining
down on the table.
ANGLE ON: Light flows through the map. GLOWING WHITE RUNES
fade into view.
[Elrond:] (CONT'D)
Stand by the gray stone when the
thrush knocks, and the setting sun
with the last light of Durin's Day
will shine upon the keyhole.
[Bilbo:]
Durin's Day?
[Gandalf:]
"It is the start of the dwarves'
near year, when the last moon of
autumn and the first sun of winter
appear in the sky together."
[Thorin:]
This is ill news. Summer is
passing. Durin's day will soon be
upon us.
[Balin:]
We still have time.
[Bilbo:]
Time? For what?
[Balin:]
To find the entrance. We have to be
standing at exactly the right spot
at exactly the right time. Then,
and only then, can the door be
opened.
[Elrond:]
So this is your purpose, to enter
the Mountain?
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 67.
74 CONTINUED: (2) 74
[Thorin:]
What of it?
[Elrond:]
There are some who would not deem
it wise.
Thorin takes back the map gruffly. Gandalf looks to Elrond.
[Gandalf:]
"What do you mean?"
[Elrond:]
You are not the only guardian to
stand watch over Middle Earth.
CLOSE ON: Elrond turns, leaving the others behind. Gandalf
turns slowly, lost in deep thought.
75 INT. DWARVEN CHAMBER - RIVENDELL - NIGHT 75
ANGLE ON: The dwarves circle around a CAMPFIRE made from
burning ELVISH FURNITURE in their quarters. Fili roasts a
SAUSAGE above the fire.
He looks over at Gloin, sitting on a bench.
[Fili:]
Gloin!
Fili throws the sausage to Gloin. As Gloin catches it, the
bench breaks beneath him. The dwarves LAUGH UPROARIOUSLY.
76 EXT. STAIRWAY - RIVENDELL - NIGHT 76
WIDE ON: Bilbo wanders onto a large stairway. His face is
etched with indecisiveness.
From far below the staircase, Gandalf and Elrond walk across
a bridge. Curious, Bilbo watches them.
[Gandalf:]
"Of course I was going to tell you,
I was waiting for this very chance.
And really, I think you can trust
that I know what I am doing."
[Elrond:]
Do you? That dragon has slept for
60 years. What will happen if your

[Elrond:] (cont'd)
plan should fail, if you wake that
beast?
[Gandalf:]
"What if we succeed? If the dwarves
take back the mountain, our
defenses in the east will be
strengthened."
[Elrond:]
It is a dangerous move, Gandalf.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo notices that Thorin is standing behind him.
He too listens in on the argument.
[Gandalf:]
"It is also dangerous to do nothing.
The throne of Erebor is Thorin's
birthright, what is it you fear?"
[Elrond:]
Have you forgotten? A strain of
madness runs deep in that family.
His grandfather lost his mind, his
father succumbed to the same
sickness. Can you swear Thorin
Oakenshield will not also fall?
Gandalf, these decisions do not
rest with us alone. It is not up to
you or me to redraw the map of
Middle Earth.
Bilbo looks back at Thorin. His face is unreadable.
77 EXT. PAVILION - RIVENDELL - NIGHT 77
ANGLE ON: Gandalf and Elrond march up a flight of marble
stairs.
[Gandalf:]
"With or without our help, these
dwarves will march on the mountain.
They are determined to reclaim
their homeland. I do not believe
Thorin Oakenshield feels that he's
answerable to anyone. Nor for that
matter am I."
[Elrond:]
It is not me you must answer to.

THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 69.
77 CONTINUED: 77
Elrond leads the wizard into a pavilion. There, a tall,
beautiful elf stands framed against the moonlight. She
slowly turns around, revealing herself to be GALADRIEL.
[Gandalf:]
"Lady Galadriel."
[Galadriel:]
Mithrandir.
(in Elvish; subtitled)
It has been a long time.
Gandalf gives her a gracious bow.
[Gandalf:]
"Age may have changed me, but not so
the Lady of Lorien."
Galadriel smiles at the wizard.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
"I had no idea Lord Elrond had sent
for you."
CLOSE ON: A voice SOUNDS FROM THE DARKNESS. Gandalf turns to
see [Saruman:] THE WHITE, sitting in a far corner.
[Saruman:]
He didn't. I did.
Gandalf bows.
[Gandalf:]
"Saruman."
[Saruman:]
You've been busy of late, my
friend.
78 EXT. PAVILION - RIVENDELL - DAY 78
ANGLE ON: Dawn breaks behind the White Council. Gandalf and
Saruman are seated at a MARBLE TABLE, while Galadriel and
Elrond circle around them.
[Saruman:]
Tell me, Gandalf. Did you think
these plans and schemes of yours
would go unnoticed.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 70.
78 CONTINUED: 78
[Gandalf:]
"Unnoticed? No, I'm simply doing
what I feel to be right."
[Galadriel:]
The dragon has long been on your
mind.
[Gandalf:]
"It is true, my lady. Smaug owes
allegiance to no one. But if he
should side with the enemy, a
dragon could be used to terrible
effect."
[Elrond:]
What do you mean?
[Gandalf:]
"There is something at work beyond
the evil of Smaug. Something far
more powerful. We can remain blind
to it, but it will not be ignoring
us, that I can promise you. A
sickness lies over the Greenwood.
The woodsmen who live there now
call it Mirkwood, and they say..."
His voice TRAILS OFF, uncertain.
[Saruman:]
Well, don't stop now. Tell us what
the woodsmen say.
[Gandalf:]
"They speak of a Necromancer living
in Dol Guldur, a sorcerer who can
summon the dead."
[Saruman:]
That's absurd. No such power exists
in this world. This Necromancer is
nothing more than a mortal man. A
conjurer dabbling in black magic.
[Gandalf:]
"And so I thought too, but Radagast
has seen -"
CLOSE ON: Saruman looks appalled.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 71.
78 CONTINUED: (2) 78
[Saruman:]
Radagast? Do not speak to of
Radagast the Brown. He is a foolish
fellow.
Gandalf SIGHS as Saruman goes on a tirade about the brown
wizard.
Galadriel stops in her tracks, staring towards Gandalf. She
begins to speak TELEPATHICALLY.
[Galadriel:] (V.O.)
You carry something. It came to you
from Radagast. He found it in Dol
Guldur.
[Gandalf:] (V.O.)
"Yes."
[Galadriel:] (V.O.)
"Show me."
ANGLE ON: From out of his robes, Gandalf slowly lifts out
Radagast's PACKAGE. He rests it on the table, letting out a
DULL THUD.
[Elrond:]
What is that?
[Galadriel:]
"A relic of Mordor."
Elrond reaches towards the package, unwrapping it.
CLOSE ON: The blade from Dol Guldur rests inside. The White
Council looks shocked.
[Elrond:]
A Morgul blade.
[Galadriel:]
Made for the Witch-king of Angmar
and buried with him. When Angmar
fell, men of the north took his
body and all that he possessed and
sealed it within the High Fells of
Rhudaur. Deep within the rock they
buried them, in a tomb so dark it
would never come to light.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 72.
78 CONTINUED: (3) 78
[Elrond:]
That is not possible. A powerful
spell lies upon those tombs; they
cannot be opened.
[Saruman:]
What proof do we have this weapon
came from Angmar's grave.
[Gandalf:]
"I have none."
[Saruman:]
Because there is none! Let us
examine what we know. A single Orc
pack has dared to cross the
Bruinen, a dagger from a bygone age
has been found, and a human
sorcerer who calls himself the
Necromancer has taken up residence
in a ruined fortress. It's not so
very much, after all.
WIDE ON: Lindir rushes into the pavilion, BREATHLESS. The
council turns to look at him.
LINDIR
My lord Elrond, the dwarves,
they've gone.
CLOSE ON: Elrond and Gandalf exchange stunned looks.
79 EXT. RIVENDELL OUTSKIRTS - DAY 79
WIDE ON: All of the dwarves are packed, hiking along the
path leaving Rivendell.
[Thorin:]
Be on your guard; we're about to
step over the edge of the wild.
Balin, you know these paths, lead
on.
[Balin:]
Aye.

longing.

Master Baggins, I suggest you keep
up.

follows behind the dwarves.
80 EXT. PAVILION - RIVENDELL - DAY 80
WIDE ON: Galadriel and Gandalf stand at the edge of the
pavillion, the sun rising behind them. Elrond and Saruman
are gone.
[Galadriel:]
You will follow them?
[Gandalf:]
"Yes."
[Galadriel:]
You are right to help Thorin
Oakenshield. But I fear this quest
has set in motion forces we do not
yet understand. The riddle of the
Morgul blade must be answered.
Something moves in the shadows,
unseen, hidden from our sight. It
will not show itself, not yet. But
everyday it grows with strength.
You must be careful.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf turns and paces up and down the pavillion.
[Galadriel:] (CONT'D)
Mithrandir, why the halfling?
Gandalf stares thoughtfully into the sunrise.
[Gandalf:]
"I do not know. Saruman believes
that it is only great power that
can hold evil in check. But that is
not what I have found. I've found
that it is the small things,
everyday deeds of ordinary folk
that keeps the darkness at bay.
Simple acts of kindess and love.
Why Bilbo Baggins? Perhaps it is
because I'm afraid and he gives me
courage."

Galadriel stands in front of Gandalf, taking his old, weary

Do not be afraid, Mithrandir. You
are not alone.
She tucks a LOOSE STRAND of Gandalf's hair back into place.
[Galadriel:] (CONT'D)
(in Elvish; subtitled)
If you should ever need my help, I
will come.
Gandalf bows, and Galadriel gently moves her hands away from
his. Gandalf looks up. Galadriel is GONE.
81 EXT. ERIADOR - DAY 81
CRANE SHOT: The dwarves trudge through the WILDERNESS OF
ERIADOR. The Misty Mountains are plain in the distance,
capped with snow. Over ranges, rivers and waterfalls they
pass, silent with determination.
Slowly, their path becomes higher and higher, looming over
the fields below. The Misty Mountains grow nearer with every
step.
82 EXT. MISTY MOUNTAINS - DAY 82
Finally, the Company finds themselves climbing the VAST
MOUNTAIN RANGE, through rock and snow, framed against the
blue sky behind them.
83 EXT. MISTY MOUNTAINS - NIGHT 83
WIDE ON: A FIERCE STORM RAGES in the air. LIGHTNING STRIKES
here and there, and RAIN POURS DOWN without mercy.
ANGLE ON: Thorin leads the dwarves across a NARROW,
DANGEROUS TRAIL on the side of the mountain. A cliff lies on
one side of the path, with a sheer drop on the other.
[Thorin:]
Hold on!
The dwarves carefully make their way across the ridge,
half-drowned in rain. As Bilbo walks, the stone beneath him
gives way. Dwalin manages to catch him in the nick of time.

[Thorin:]
We must find shelter!
CLOSE ON: Dwalin points up, looking at something in the
distance.
[Dwalin:]
Look out!
WIDE ON: A MASSIVE BOULDER hurtles through the air. It hits
the mountainside above the dwarves, sending rocks crumbling
down around them as they press themselves against the
mountain.
CLOSE ON: Balin steps forward, pointing up at the sky.
[Balin:]
This is no thunder storm! It's a
thunder battle! Look!
WIDE ON: A MASSIVE STONE GIANT rears up from a nearby
mountain. It rips a giant CHUNK OF STONE from the top of the
mountain.
[Fili:]
Well, bless me! The legends are
true! Giants; stone giants!
The stone giant throws the rock across the valley. It
crashes into ANOTHER STONE GIANT, rising from the
mountainside. The dwarves watch, caught in the middle.
[Thorin:]
Take cover, you'll fall!
ANGLE ON: Debris begin to fall over the Company once again.
The dwarves hold onto the mountainside as the ground beneath
them begins to CRACK and SPLIT, separating the dwarves.
[Fili:]
Kili, grab my hand! Kili!
Kili, Oin, Gloin and Thorin begin to drift away from the
others.
WIDE ON: The dwarves stand on the knees of a THIRD STONE
GIANT, who rises slowly to the fight. The second stone giant
lumbers over, HEADBUTTING the third giant.
ANGLE ON: As the giant falls backwards, Bilbo and the
dwarves are sent TUMBLING forwards and backwards, hanging
(CONTINUED)

onto the mountainside for dear life. Thorin, Oin, Gloin and
Kili manage to jump onto the still side of the mountain.
WIDE ON: The third giant rises back up again. Slowly, the
second throws a punch, sending it falling back into its
place on the mountain.
ANGLE ON: Thorin and the other watch, helpless, as the rest
of the Company is seemingly crushed between the stone.
[Thorin:]
NO!
Thorin runs forward across the ledge. He runs along the
path, finding them alive and well.
[Gloin:]
It's alright! They're alive!
Fili scans the mountainside. There is no side of Bilbo.
[Fili:]
Where's Bilbo?
He looks over the edge, shocked to find Bilbo dangling off
the edge of the cliff.
[Fili:] (CONT'D)
There!
CLOSE ON: The dwarves clamor around the cliff, trying to
pull him up.
ANGLE ON: Thorin swings down on the cliff next to Bilbo and
boosts him up. The others haul him onto the ledge. Thorin
climbs up behind Bilbo.
[Dwalin:]
I thought we'd lost our burglar.
[Thorin:]
He's been lost ever since he left
home. He should never have come. He
has no place amongst us.
(turns to the dwarves)
Now, we must find shelter.
The dwarves nod in agreement, following after Thorin's lead.
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 77.
84 INT. CAVE - MISTY MOUNTAINS - NIGHT 84
ANGLE ON: The Company enters a cave. It is dark, still and
silent.
[Dwalin:]
It looks safe enough.
[Thorin:]
Search to the back; caves in
mountains are seldom unoccupied.
Dwalin searches the back of the cave, LANTERN IN HAND. After
a brief investigation, he returns to the others.
[Dwalin:]
There's nothing here.
Gloin drops a BUNDLE OF WOOD on the floor. He grins, rubbing
his hands together.
[Gloin:]
Right then! Let's get a fire
started.
[Thorin:]
No. No fires, not in this place.
Get some sleep. We start at first
light.
[Balin:]
We were to wait in the mountains
until Gandalf joined us. That was
the plan.
[Thorin:]
Plans change.
Thorin turns to Fili.
[Thorin:] (CONT'D)
Fili, take the first watch.
85 INT. CAVE - MISTY MOUNTAINS - NIGHT - LATER 85
WIDE ON: All of the dwarves are asleep, resting on top of
PILES OF LUGGAGE.
CLOSE ON: From the corner of the cave, Bilbo opens his eyes.
Seeing that no one is awake, he quietly rolls up his
blankets and packs his things.

ANGLE ON: Packed and ready, Bilbo makes for the cave
entrance. Fili sees him and jumps up.
[Fili:]
Where do you think you're going?
[Bilbo:]
Back to Rivendell.
[Fili:]
No, no, you can't turn back now,
you're part of the company. You're
one of us.
[Bilbo:]
I'm not though, am I? Thorin said I
should never have come, and he was
right. I'm not a Took, I'm a
Baggins, I don't know what I was
thinking. I should have never ran
out my door.
CLOSE ON: Thorin, awake, stares thoughtfully at the walls,
listening.
[Fili:]
You're homesick; I understand.
[Bilbo:]
No, you don't! You don't
understand, none of you do - you're
dwarves! You're used to this life,
to living on the road, never
settling in one place, not
belonging anywhere.
Fili looks slightly offended. Bilbo gives an apologetic
look.
[Bilbo:]
I'm sorry, I didn't mean -
Fili shakes his head, looking down at his sleeping
companions.
[Fili:]
No, you're right. We don't belong
anywhere.
(looks to Bilbo)
I wish you all the luck in the
world. I really do.

Beaming, Fili places his hand on Bilbo's shoulder. Bilbo and
Fili exchange one final look, before Bilbo turns around to
the exit.
[Fili:]
What's that?
Fili points to his belt. Bilbo looks down. He pulls his
sword partway out of its sheath. IT GLOWS BLUE.
ANGLE ON: Suddenly, STRANGE MECHANICAL NOISES comes from the
ground. Thorin raises his head, seeing the sandy ground
beneath him CRACK APART.
[Thorin:]
Wake up! Wake up!
Before anyone can react, the cave floor COLLAPSES DOWNWARDS.
86 INT. GOBLIN CHUTE - MISTY MOUNTAINS - NIGHT 86
The entire Company goes SAILING DOWN A CHUTE, sliding
through tunnels and passages. The dwarves SCREAM as they are
thrown downwards.
87 INT. GOBLIN CAGES - MISTY MOUNTAINS - NIGHT 87
ANGLE ON: All of the dwarves fall onto a WOODEN CAGE. As
they struggle to rise, a HORDE OF GOBLINS attack them.
CLOSE ON: The creatures viciously take their weapons,
pushing them forwards. The dwarves attempt to fight back, to
no avail.
ANGLE ON: As they are led away, Bilbo crouches out of sight.
The passing goblins do not even spare him a glance.
CLOSE ON: Oin looks over his shoulder and sees Bilbo. Before
he can do anything, the goblins push him forward.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo scampers to hide behind the RAILINGS. He
watches as the goblins proceed through the darkness. Bilbo
draws out his sword. He follows behind the goblin's path,
unseen.
Suddenly, ONE GOBLIN jumps out in front of him. Armed with a
DAGGER, the goblin rushes forward. Steel meets steel, and
Bilbo barely manages to keep himself alive.
The goblin LEAPS on top of Bilbo, biting into his shoulder.
Bilbo staggers back, falling over the railings. Together,

TRACKING SHOT: The goblins lead the dwarves down a vast
network of TUNNELS AND WOODEN BRIDGES. Thousands of other
goblins look on, SNARLING.
89 INT. THRONE ROOM - GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT 89
WIDE ON: They are led into the massive throne room and
brought to the feet of THE GREAT GOBLIN.
CLOSE ON: With a WHEEZE and a COUGH, The Great Goblin
lounges on his throne. He is far larger and far uglier than
any other goblin.
ANGLE ON: The goblins pile the dwarves' weapons together.
The Great Goblin leaps from his throne, leaning on a
SKULL-TOPPED MACE for support.
GREAT GOBLIN
Who would be so bold as to come
armed into my kingdom? Spies?
Thieves? Assassins?
His second in command, GRINNAH, steps forward.
GRINNAH
Dwarves, your malevolence.
GREAT GOBLIN
Dwarves?
GRINNAH
We found them on the Front Porch.
GREAT GOBLIN
Well, don't just stand there!
Search them! Every crack, every
crevice.
The goblins rush forward, searching thoroughly. Whatever
they find, the goblins throw on the ground and destroy.
CLOSE ON: One particular goblin grabs Oin's hearing trumpet
and crushes it underfoot.
GREAT GOBLIN
What are you doing in these parts?

ANGLE ON: The dwarves hesitate. The Great Goblin grins.
GREAT GOBLIN (CONT'D)
Very well, if they will not talk,
we'll make them squawk! Bring out
the mangler! Bring out the bone
breaker! Start with the youngest.
He points to Kili. Thorin quickly steps forward.
[Thorin:]
Wait!
GREAT GOBLIN
Well, well, well, look who it is!
Thorin, son of Thrain, son of
Thror, King Under The Mountain.
The Great Goblin gives a mocking bow.
GREAT GOBLIN (CONT'D)
Oh, but I'm forgetting, you don't
have a mountain. And you're not a
king. Which makes you nobody,
really. But I know someone who
would pay a pretty price for your
head. Just the head, nothing
attached. Perhaps you know of whom
I speak. A vengeful enemy of yours.
CLOSE ON: Thorin looks up in disbelief.
[Thorin:]
Bolg of the North?
The other dwarves look shocked. The Great Goblin chuckles at
their surprise.
ANGLE ON: He turns to the tiny GOBLIN SCRIBE, sitting in a
BASKET.
GREAT GOBLIN
Send word to Bolg of the North.
Tell him, I have found his prize.
The scribe writes down this message on a SLATE. With a
CACKLE, he PULLS A LEVER and sails off into the dark caverns
below.

90 INT. GOBLIN TUNNELS - MISTY MOUNTAINS - NIGHT 90
CLOSE ON: Bilbo lies in a clump of mushrooms. Slowly, he
regains consciousness. The goblin he dueled lies further
off, GASPING FOR BREATH.
ANGLE ON: Out of the darkness, a strange figure approaches.
Walking on all fours, it crawls to the goblin. It is GOLLUM.
[Gollum:]
Yes, yes, yes!
(starts to cough)
Gollum. Gollum.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo hides behind the mushrooms. He watches
Gollum circle around the goblin.
ANGLE ON: Gollum drags the goblin by his feet. Suddenly, it
springs to life, grabbing Gollum. In response, Gollum grabs
a near ROCK, and pounds it against the goblin's head.
CLOSE ON: As Gollum beats down on the goblin, a GOLDEN RING
falls out of his loincloth. It lands on the ground with a
SOFT THUD.
ANGLE ON: The goblin falls backwards, knocked out. Gollum
continues to pull the goblin away.
[Gollum:] (CONT'D)
Nasty goblinses. Better than old
bones, precious. Better than
nothing!
Gollum rounds a corner, out of sight. Once he is gone, Bilbo
jumps out of the mushroom patch and retrieves his sword. It
still GLOWS BLUE.
CLOSE ON: By the light of the sword, Bilbo sees the Ring
below him. Intrigued, he picks it up and examines it.
Gollum begins to MOAN in the distance. Without a second
thought, Bilbo drops the Ring in his pocket. He follows the
sound of Gollum's voice.
[Smeagol:]
Too many boneses, precious. Not
enough flesh!
[Gollum:]
Shut up! Get its skin off. Start
with its head.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 83.
90 CONTINUED: 90
WIDE ON: Bilbo creeps around the corner. He sees Gollum, or
in this case SMEAGOL, silhouetted on top of an OUTCROPPING
ROCK in the middle of a SMALL LAKE. Smeagol sings joyfully
as he beats the goblin.
[Smeagol:]
(singing)
The cold hard lands, they bites our
hands, they gnaws our feet. The
rocks and stones, they're like old
bones, all bare of meat. Cold as
death, they have no breath, its
good to eat.
With a HOWL, the goblin wakes again, but Gollum is too quick
for him. He smashes in the goblin's head with another stone.
Suddenly, Gollum looks up and sees the glow of Bilbo's
sword.
ANGLE ON: Panicked, Bilbo dives behind a boulder. The light
of his sword slowly FLICKERS AWAY. The goblin is dead. Bilbo
peers over at Gollum's rock with caution.
He is gone.
CLOSE ON: Gollum is mounted on a SMALL, WOODEN BOAT. Using
his hands as paddles, he swims across the lake.
Bilbo still hides behind the rock. His breath is QUICK AND
PAINED. He is afraid.
From behind him, he hears a SCUFFLING NOISE. Bilbo turns to
look up. Gollum is climbing the rock above. He jumps down,
and gives Bilbo a toothy grin.
[Gollum:]
Bless us and splash us, precious!
That's a meaty mouthful!
ANGLE ON: Gollum crawls towards Bilbo. The hobbit points the
tip of his sword at Gollum's throat. He retreats in fear.
[Gollum:] (CONT'D)
Gollum. Gollum.
[Bilbo:]
Back! Stay back! I'm warning you,
don't come any closer.
Bilbo rises, pointing the blade down at Gollum.

[Gollum:]
It's got an elvish blade, but its

CLOSE ON: Gollum squints up at Bilbo, perplexed.
[Gollum:] (CONT'D)
What is it, precious? What is it?
[Bilbo:]
My name is Bilbo Baggins.
[Gollum:]
Bagginses? What is a Bagginses,
precious?
[Bilbo:]
I'm a hobbit, from the Shire.
[Gollum:]
Oh! We like goblinses, batses and
fishes, but we haven't tried
hobbitses before. Is it soft? Is it
juicy?
Gollum steps closer to Bilbo, mouth watering. Bilbo holds
out his sword, waving it wildly about.
[Bilbo:]
Now, now, keep your distance! I'll
use this if I have to!
WIDE ON: Gollum SNARLS LOUDLY. It echos across the cave.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
I don't want any trouble, do you
understand? Just show me the way to
get out of here, and I'll be on my
way!
[Gollum:]
Why? Is it lost?
[Bilbo:]
Yes, yes, and I want to be unlost
as soon as possible.
Gollum's face lights up. Smeagol has returned.

dark.
[Gollum:]
Shut up!
Bilbo frowns.
[Bilbo:]
I didn't say anything.
[Gollum:]
Wasn't talking to you.
CLOSE ON: Gollum crouches behind an OUTCROPPING STONE.
[Smeagol:]
Well, yes, we was, precious, we
was.
[Bilbo:]
Look, I don't know what your game
is, but I -
Suddenly, Smeagol leaps onto the stone, excited.
[Smeagol:]
Games? We love games, doesn't we,
precious?
(to Bilbo)
Does it like games? Does it? Does
it? Does it like to play?
[Bilbo:]
Maybe?
Smeagol holds up his hand and begins to recite a riddle.
[Smeagol:]
What has roots as nobody sees, is
taller than trees. Up, up, up it
goes, and yet never grows.
Bilbo takes some time to think it over.
[Bilbo:]
The mountain.

[Smeagol:]
Yes, yes! Oh, let's have another
one. Come on, do it again, do it
again! Ask us.
[Gollum:]
NO! No more riddles! Finish him
off! Finish him now! Gollum!
Gollum!
ANGLE ON: Gollum begins to lunge at Bilbo. Bilbo holds up a
hand.
[Bilbo:]
No! No! I want to play, I do. I can
see that you are very good at this.
So, why don't we have a game of
riddles? Yes? Just you and me.
Smeagol scuttles forward, excited.
[Smeagol:]
Just us?
[Bilbo:]
Yes. Yes. And if I win, you show me
the way out.
CLOSE ON: With a GROWL, Gollum turns away. He crouches
behind the stone, speaking to his Smeagol half.
[Gollum:]
And if it loses? What then?
[Smeagol:]
If it loses, precious, then we eats
it.
Smeagol pops out from behind the stone.
[Smeagol:] (CONT'D)
If Baggins loses, we eats it whole.
Bilbo pauses, digesting this information. Reluctantly, he
begins to sheath his sword.
[Bilbo:]
Fair enough.
Smeagol looks up at him, expectant.

[Smeagol:]
Well, Baggins first.
[Bilbo:]
Thirty white horses on a red hill.
First they champ, then they stamp,
then they stand still.
Smeagol thinks long and hard. Finally, he replies.
[Smeagol:]
Teeth?
Bilbo looks unhappy; Smeagol is correct.
[Smeagol:] (CONT'D)
(laughing)
Teeth! Yes, my precious! But we, we
only have nine.
Smeagol opens his mouth wide, displaying his nine teeth.
Bilbo is disgusted.
[Smeagol:] (CONT'D)
Our turn. Voiceless it cries,
wingless flutter, toothless bites,
mouthless mutters.
ANGLE ON: Smegol creeps forward, unsettling Bilbo. He tries
is best to keep a rock between the two of them.
[Bilbo:]
Just a minute.
Bilbo walks off to the side of the lake. Smeagol suddenly
becomes excited.
[Smeagol:]
Oh, we knows! We knows!
[Gollum:]
Shut up!
CLOSE ON: Bilbo watches the lake water, thinking. A SOFT
BREEZE ruffles the surface of the water. Bilbo grins.
[Bilbo:]
Wind. It's wind. Of course it is!

[Gollum:]
Very clever, hobbitses, very

Gollum clambers forward, SNARLING. Bilbo unsheathes his
sword, pointing it down at Gollum.
[Bilbo:]
A box without hinges, key or lid,
yet golden treasure inside is hid.
Smeagol turns around, MUTTERING to himself.
[Smeagol:]
Box... and a lid, then a key...
[Bilbo:]
Well?
[Smeagol:]
It's nasty.
Smeagol paces up and down the slab of rock. Bilbo looms over
him, triumphant.
[Bilbo:]
Give up?
[Smeagol:]
Give us a chance, precious, give us
a chance!
Frustrated, Smeagol pounds down at the floor. He PUCKERS HIS
FACE, deep in furious thought. Suddenly, he opens his eyes,
smiling widely.
[Smeagol:]
Eggses!
Bilbo frowns. Smeagol has gotten right yet another riddle.
[Smeagol:] (CONT'D)
Eggses! Wet, crunchy, little
eggses. Grandmother taught us to
suck them, yes!
A BAT SQUEALS in the distance. Startled, Bilbo looks around
for the bat. He looks back down. Smeagol is gone, but his
voice echoes from across the cave.

grinds hards stone to meal.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo paces around the rock, sword raised
defensively. Eyebrows furrowed, he thinks to solve the
riddle.
[Gollum:]
Answer us!
[Bilbo:]
Give me a moment, please! I gave
you a good long while.
Bilbo walks in circles around the slab, shaking his head.
[Bilbo:]
I don't know this one.
[Gollum:]
Is it tasty? Is it scrumptious? Is
it crunchable?
Out of nowhere, Gollum appears behind Bilbo and grabs his
neck. Bilbo jumps away, aiming his sword straight at Gollum.
[Bilbo:]
Let me think. Let me think.
Slowly, Bilbo backs away. Smeagol watches with a grin.
[Smeagol:]
It's stuck. Bagginses is stuck.
Bilbo paces back and forth, frustrated.
[Smeagol:]
Time's up.
CLOSE ON: Smeagol gives an eerie smile. Bilbo turns around,
a grin is wide on his face.

Behind his back, Gollum grasps onto a ROCK. Bilbo doesn't
notice. He is too busy thinking of a riddle.
[Gollum:] (CONT'D)
Ask us. Ask us!
[Bilbo:]
Yes, yes, all right.
WIDE ON: Bilbo strolls to the edge of the bank. He
absentmindedly rubs his pocket. He feels the Ring inside.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
What have I got in my pocket?
[Smeagol:]
That's not fair. That's not fair,
it's against the rules!
ANGLE ON: Smeagol throws down the rock in his fury. Bilbo
looks at it, startled.
[Smeagol:] (CONT'D)
Ask us another one!
Bilbo steps closer, shaking his head.
[Bilbo:]
No, no, no. You said, 'ask me a
question'. Well, I did. What have I
got in my pocket?
[Smeagol:]
Three guesses, precious. It must
give us three!
[Bilbo:]
Three guesses. Very well, guess
away.
[Smeagol:]
Handses.
Bilbo pulls his hands out just in time.

Wrong, guess again.

Oh, shut up!
[Bilbo:]
Wrong again. Last guess.
[Smeagol:]
String! Or nothing.
[Bilbo:]
Two guesses at once. Wrong, both
times.
Smeagol falls to the floor, CRYING in his defeat. Bilbo
looms over him, victorious.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
Come on then, I won the game. You
promised to show me the way out.
CLOSE ON: Gollum gets to his feet, his back turned.
[Gollum:]
Did we say so, precious? Did we say
so?
Slowly, Gollum turns around. He glares up at Bilbo.
[Gollum:] (CONT'D)
What has it got in its pocketses?
[Bilbo:]
That's no concern of yours. You
lost.
Gollum grins as he approaches Bilbo. He reaches for
something hidden at his side.
His face registers in shock. Whatever he is looking for, it
is not there.

Where is it? Where is it? No! No!
No!

[Gollum:] (CONT'D)
Lost! Curses and splashes, my
precious is lost!
It dawns on Bilbo. He takes the Ring from his pocket and
hides it behind his back.
[Bilbo:]
What have you lost?
[Gollum:]
Mustn't ask us! Not its business!
Gollum, gollum!
CLOSE ON: Gollum leans over the edge of the lake, SOBBING.
He stares at his reflection, and slowly his cries begin to
cease. Gollum's face becomes contorted in anger.
[Gollum:] (CONT'D)
What has it got in its nasty,
little pocketses?
Bilbo's grasp around the Ring tightens. Slowly, Gollum turns
to look at Bilbo. His face is pale with shock.
[Gollum:] (CONT'D)
He stole it. He stole it! HE STOLE
IT!
SNARLING, Gollum throws a STONE at Bilbo. He manages to
deflect it with his sword, and runs off, deeper into the
tunnels. Gollum chases after him, ROARING.
91 INT. THRONE ROOM - GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT 91

TORTURE into the throne room. The Great Goblin prances
around his throne, singing a HORRENDOUS SONG.
GREAT GOBLIN

They HOWL IN FEAR.
GREAT GOBLIN
I know that sword! It is the Goblin
Cleaver! The Biter! The blade that
sliced a thousand necks!

WEAPONS and beat the dwarves to the ground.
GREAT GOBLIN (CONT'D)

Kill them all!

Cut off his head!

above his head.
WIDE ON: Suddenly, there is a vast EXPLOSION OF WHITE LIGHT.
The goblins and the torture machines go FLYING, while the
dwarves are knocked to the ground.
The explosion passes. A shadow is framed against the dim
light. It is Gandalf, armed with sword and staff.
ANGLE ON: Slowly, the dwarves and the goblins recover from
the shockwave. All eyes turn to Gandalf.
[Gandalf:]
"Take up arms. Fight. Fight!"
The dwarves jump to their feet, fending off the goblins.
Gandalf slices through the oncoming goblins like butter. The
Great Goblin points to Gandalf's sword, TREMBLING.
GREAT GOBLIN
He wields the Foe-Hammer. The
Beater, bright as daylight!
The dwarves manage to reach their weapons. AXES, SWORDS, and
HAMMERS are tossed from this dwarf to that dwarf. Together,
they charge into battle, SHOUTING WAR CRIES.
Kili slices through goblins, spraying BLACK BLOOD. They fall

The Great Goblin rises to his feet. He charges forward,
bringing his mace down on Kili. Thorin intervenes,
deflecting the Great Goblin's blow.
With a FRIGHTENED HOWL, the Great Goblin falls backwards and
off of the platform. He goes sailing down into the abyss
below, SCREAMING LIKE A COWARD.
CLOSE ON: The dwarves butcher the goblins, fighting with
great severity. Gandalf approaches the dwarves, urgent.

Gollum SHOUTS from the distance.
[Gollum:]
Give it to us!
Bilbo dives into a cave on his left, PANTING. He sees Gollum
crawl past the entrance. Relieved, Bilbo makes for a crack
in the cave wall.
He squeezes through the cranny. However, his SHIRT BUTTONS
catch along the edges. He is stuck.
From outside, Gollum backtracks. He locks eyes with Bilbo.
He SNARLS, and rushes into the cave.
[Gollum:] (CONT'D)
It's ours! It's ours!
Bilbo exhales and pushes as hard as he can.
CLOSE ON: He manages to fit through the crack, but his brass

leaps into the cave. Gollum looks around for Bilbo,
confused.
In Bilbo's state of vision, everything is BLURRED and
COLORLESS.

Thief! Baggins!
As Gollum ROARS, the sound seems to be COMPRESSED. He darts

ANGLE ON: Still invisible, Bilbo approaches Gollum, sword
drawn. He watches as Gollum peers out of the tunnel exit,
distressed.
Suddenly, SHUFFLING FOOSTEPS sound from nearby. Gollum
rushes back into the tunnel, and hides out of sight. The

It is Gandalf. He leads the dwarves out of the tunnel,
urgently BARKING COMMANDS. Bilbo watches them, FRANTIC.

Gollum turns back around. Although he cannot see him, Gollum

SALTY TEARS begin to well in Gollum's eyes. For a second, he
seems almost human.
Out of pity, Bilbo lowers his sword. He takes a DEEP BREATH,
and steps back. Gollum begins to SNARL, hearing him. Bilbo
runs forward and leaps over Gollum, knocking him down in the
process.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo flees out of the exit, into the daylight.
CLOSE ON: Enraged, Gollum jumps to his feet. He scrabbles
around himself, grabbing for Bilbo.

six. And Dwalin, that makes seven."
Gandalf looks around him for Bilbo.

None of the dwarves answer.

I think I saw him slip away when
they fist cornered us.
Gandalf becomes greatly discontent. Almost panicked.
[Gandalf:]
"What happened exactly? Tell me!"
[Thorin:]
I'll tell you what happened. Master
Baggins saw his chance and he took
it. He's thought of nothing but his
soft bed and his warm hearth since
first he stepped out of his door.
We will not be seeing our hobbit
again. He is long gone.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo leans against the tree, seemingly CRUSHED.
The dwarves look at one another, indifferent.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo, NOW VISIBLE, steps out from behind the
tree.
[Bilbo:]
No, he isn't.
The dwarves look surprised. Gandalf's face lights up in
relief.
[Gandalf:]
"Bilbo Baggins! I've never been so
glad to see anyone in my life!"
Bilbo steps closer. The dwarves circle around him, stunned.
[Kili:]
Bilbo! We'd given you up!

goblins?

How, indeed.

[Thorin:]
It matters. I want to know; why did
you come back?
[Bilbo:]
"Look, I know you doubt me. I know
you always have. And you're right.
I often think of Bag End. I miss my
books, and my armchair, and my
garden. See, that's where I belong.
That's home. And you don't have
one, a home. It was taken from you.
But I will help you take it back if
I can."
CLOSE ON: The dwarves are taken aback. Slowly, it dawns on
them: Bilbo cares. Gandalf, impressed, shares a warm smile
with the hobbit.
97 EXT. CLIFFSIDE - WILDERLAND - DAY 97
ANGLE ON: Looming above the dwarves, a TROOP OF ORCS ride to
the edge of the cliff. At the head of the pack rides BOLG OF
THE NORTH.
Half blind, muscular and tall, Bolg looks to be a force to
be reckoned with. He turns to the Orcs behind him, pointing
forward.
BOLG

weapons drawn. Suddenly, an EAR SPLITTING ROAR rings through
the forest.
ANGLE ON: The orc pack skids to a halt, looking for the
noise.
Further along, the dwarves come to a stop. The look in
dismay at one another.
[Gandalf:]
"This way, quickly!"
Gandalf resumes his run. With haste, Bilbo and the dwarves
follow after him.
101 EXT. PLAINS - WILDERLAND - DAY 101
WIDE ON: Gandalf points forward. A LARGE, WOODEN HOUSE
surrounded by TREES and HEDGES is seen in the distance.
[Gandalf:]
"To the house! Run!"
The ROARING ECHOS from behind them. The dwarves run a little
faster, drawing nearer and nearer to the house.
102 EXT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - DAY 102
CRANE SHOT: Eventually, the Company reaches the house. They
sprint through a GATE between the hedges.
[Gandalf:]
"Come on, get inside!"
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 100.
102 CONTINUED: 102
ANGLE ON: The dwarves rush to the door, BUMBLEBEES BUZZING
past them. They reach the door, throwing themselves against
it in desperation.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf looks as a MASSIVE BEAR breaks out from
the edge of the forest and barrels towards them.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
"Open the door!"
Thorin pushes through the dwarves. He manages to raise the
EXTERIOR BOLT, opening the doors. As the bear crashes
through the gate, the entire company floods into the home.
103 INT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - DAY 103
The dwarves attempt to slam the door shut. However, the bear
pushes his head inside, ROARING and SNARLING.
Panicked, the dwarves push against the door, SCREAMING.
Bilbo withdraws his sword and points it up at the bear.
Gandalf only watches, calm.
With a final heave, the dwarves manage to close the door and
drop the bolt across it. Catching their breath, everyone
looks to Gandalf.
[Bilbo:]
What is that?
[Gandalf:]
"That is our host. His name is Beorn
and he's a skinchanger. Sometimes
he's a huge, black bear, sometimes
he's a great, strong man. The bear
is unpredictable, but the man can
be reasoned with. However, he is
not overfond of dwarves."
The dwarves look at one another, distressed. Bilbo peaks
through a crack in the door.
[Bilbo:]
He's leaving.
Fili steps forward. He places a hand on Bilbo's shoulder.
[Fili:]
Get away from there. It's not
natural, none of it. He's under
some dark spell.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 101.
103 CONTINUED: 103
[Gandalf:]
"Don't be ridiculous. He's under no
enchantment but his own.
Alright now, get some rest, all of
you. You'll be safe here tonight."
ANGLE ON: The dwarves begin to spread through the house.
104 INT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - NIGHT 104
Most of the dwarves sleep throughout the house, peaceful and
at ease. Thorin sits beside a window, looking out at the
VAST FIELDS. Gandalf sits among the resting dwarves, smoking
his pipe.
Bilbo and Balin are seated at the kitchen table, staring
into the CRACKLING FLAMES.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo turns to Balin, confused.
[Bilbo:]
Balin, who was that out there? The
orc?
[Balin:]
Bolg of the North. An ancient enemy
of Durin's Folk.
[Bilbo:]
Ancient enemy. That's why he's
chasing us?
[Balin:]
Aye. After the dragon took the
Lonely Mountain, Thorin's
grandfather, King Thror, tried to
reclaim the ancient dwarf kingdom
of Moria.
105 EXT. MORIA GATES - MISTY MOUNTAINS - DAY (FLASHBACK) 105
WIDE ON: THOUSANDS OF DWARVES fight THOUSANDS OF ORCS before
the great gates of Moria. YOUNGER VERSIONS of Thorin, Balin
and Dwalin fight alongside THRAIN, Thorin's father, and the
great KING THROR.
[Balin:] (V.O.)
But our enemy had gotten there
first.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 102.
105 CONTINUED: 105
Bodies drop left and right. Fatal blows are dealt to both
armies. With one fall of their swords, Thorin, Thrain and
Thror fight off the orcs with great skill.
Amongst the carnage, a pale-white orc looms over the armies,
SCARS strewn across his bare chest. AZOG THE DEFILER.
He gives a MIGHTY ROAR, wiping out dwarves with his MASSIVE
MACE.
[Balin:] (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Moria had been taken by legions of
orcs led by the most vile of all
their race. Bolg's father, Azog the
Defiler. The giant Gunabad Orc had
sworn to wipe out the line of
Durin.
CLOSE ON: Azog spots Thror in the battlefield and lumbers
forward. The dwarven king looks small and weak compared to
his colossal enemy.
106 INT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - NIGHT 106
Thorin listens from the window as he stares into the wild.
Bilbo listen eagerly from the table.
[Balin:]
He began by beheading the king.
Tears well in Balin's eyes, REMEMBERING.
107 EXT. MORIA GATES - MISTY MOUNTAINS - DAY (FLASHBACK) 107
WIDE ON: Azog ROARS IN TRIUMPH. He holds King Thror's
SEVERED HEAD high above him for all to see.
CLOSE ON: Azog flings the head forward. It bounces and
tumbles down the rocky earth, landing directly at Thorin's
feet.
[Thorin:]
NO!
108 INT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - NIGHT 108
Gandalf's pipe drops from his mouth. He is disturbed by this
tale, even though he has heard it before.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 103.
108 CONTINUED: 108
[Balin:]
Thrain, Thorin's father, was driven
mad by grief. He went missing,
taken prisoner or killed. We do not
know.
Thorin has a pained look about his face as Balin presses on.
109 EXT. MORIA GATES - MISTY MOUNTAINS - DAY (FLASHBACK) 109
WIDE ON: Rank upon rank of orc armies massacre the dwarves.
Their bodies fall from the cliffs around Moria. A MORBID
WATERFALL.
[Balin:] (V.O.)
We were leaderless. Defeat and
death were upon us.
Dwarves begin to flee the battleground. The orcs have the
upper hand.
110 INT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - NIGHT 110
CLOSE ON: Balin looks to Thorin, still facing the window.
His face glows with pride. The dwarves begin to STIR from
the ground.
[Balin:]
That is when I saw him. The young
dwarf prince facing down the Pale
Orc.
111 EXT. MORIA GATES - MISTY MOUNTAINS - DAY (FLASHBACK) 111
ANGLE ON: Thorin marches toward Azog, ready for battle. He
is armed with SWORD AND SHIELD, a FINE PLATE OF ARMOR
protecting him.
[Balin:] (V.O.)
He stood alone against this
terrible foe.
Azog swings his mace, knocking away Thorin's shield. Thorin
hacks at Azog, but with another swing of the mace, he finds
his sword flying out of his hands as well.
The force of the blow causes Thorin to fall backwards. Azog
makes his way towards him, GOING IN FOR THE KILL. Just then,
Thorin grabs a near OAKEN BRANCH, dodging at Azog's swing.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 104.
111 CONTINUED: 111
Thorin gets to his feet again, blocking every fall of Azog's
mace with his branch.
[Balin:] (V.O.) (CONT'D)
His armor rent, he wielded nothing
but an oaken branch as a shield.
CLOSE ON: A powerful swing sends Thorin to the ground once
again. Azog looms over Thorin, ready to kill. A fallen sword
lies beside Thorin. Quickly, he picks up the weapon and
rises.
ANGLE ON: Thorin charges forward, his sword meeting with
Azog's mace. Determined, Thorin checks a blow against Azog.
The orc stumbles backwards. He swings his sword, slicing off
Azog's head. Thorin has cut the head off the snake.
[Balin:] (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Azog the Defiler learned that day
that the Line of Durin could not be
so easily broken. From that day
forth, Bolg had sworn to avenge his
father.
WIDE ON: Thorin raises Azog's head above his own, SHOUTING
WAR CRIES. Bolg looks on from the battleground, enraged.
Thorin rallies his men, charging against their enemies with
savage force. The remaining orcs are wiped out.
[Balin:] (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Our forces rallied and drove the
orcs back. Our enemy had been
defeated.
CROSSFADE:
112 EXT. MORIA GATES - MISTY MOUNTAINS - DAY - LATER (FLASHBACK) 112
The empty battlefield is covered in the corpses of dwarves
and orcs alike.
CLOSE ON: The surviving dwarves weep with one another over
their losses.
[Balin:] (V.O.)
But there was no feast nor song
that night, for our dead were
beyond the count of grief. We few
had survived.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 105.
112 CONTINUED: 112
Balin, battle-scarred and weeping, looks up at the field. He
spots Thorin striding across the battleground, his oaken
branch in hand.
[Balin:] (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And I thought to myself then: there
is one who I could follow. There is
one I could call king.
113 INT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - NIGHT 113
Thorin turns away from the window, visibly moved. All of the
dwarves have woken and are standing in awe before Thorin. A
warm smile splits across Balin's face.
Bilbo still seems befuddled.
[Bilbo:]
But Bolg of the North, he's still
out there.
Thorin steps closer to Bilbo, swollen in his pride.
[Thorin:]
Aye. But we'll be waiting for him.
Gandalf and Thorin exchange glances. A hint of doubt lies
under Gandalf's smile.
114 EXT. FOREST - WILDERLAND - NIGHT 114
ANGLE ON: Bolg and his company watch the house from a
distance. Beorn, in his bear form, circles around the house,
GROWLING. Yazneg approaches Bolg.
YAZENG
(in Black Speech;
subtitled)
Attack them now. Kill the dwarf
filth while they sleep.
BOLG
(in Black Speech;
subtitled)
No. The Beast stands guard. We will
kill them on the road.
Bolg turns, looking towards his WARGS.
WIDE ON: He and his orcs mount the fierce beasts and ride
off into the distance. Beorn ambles after them. The bear

114 CONTINUED: 114
stumbles over.
Slowly, HIS FORM MELTS into that of a TALL MAN. He rises to
his feet, staring to his house in the distance.
115 INT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - NIGHT 115
ANGLE ON: Everyone is asleep. Suddenly, there is a RUSTLING
NOISE. Bilbo wakes, quietly peeking out of his BLANKETS. He
sees Beorn enter the house. With a SIGH, Beorn closes the
door behind him.
116 EXT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - DAY 116
CLOSE ON: PONIES prance through the field, their manes
fluttering in the wind
117 INT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - DAY 117
A very large BUMBLEBEE lands on Bilbo's nose. He wakes with
a start. The bee flies off, alarmed.
WIDE ON: Quickly, Bilbo puts on his jacket and walks towards
the kitchen. Gandalf and the dwarves are all gathered there,
with Beorn looming over them.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo sits down at the table. Beorn pours a GLASS
OF MILK for Fili, locking eyes with Thorin.
[Beorn:]
So you are the one they call
Oakenshield? Tell me, why is Bolg
of the North hunting you?
[Thorin:]
You know of Bolg? How?
[Beorn:]
My people were the first to live in
the mountains, before the orcs came
down from the north. Bolg and his
father Azog killed most of my
family, but some he enslaved. Not
for work, you understand, but for
sport. Caging skin-changers and
torturing them seemed to amuse him.
Bilbo notices the remnants of MANACLES around Beorn's wrist.
[Bilbo:]
There are others like you?
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 107.
117 CONTINUED: 117
[Beorn:]
Once there were many.
[Bilbo:]
And now?
[Beorn:]
Now there is only one.
WIDE ON: Beorn sets down the MILK PITCHER. The dwarves look
on in silence.
[Beorn:] (CONT'D)
You need to reach the mountain
before the last days of autumn?
[Gandalf:]
"Before Durin's Day falls, yes."
[Beorn:]
You are running out of time.
[Gandalf:]
"Which is why we must go through
Mirkwood."
[Beorn:]
A darkness lies upon that forest.
Fell things creep beneath those
trees. I would not venture there
except in great need.
[Gandalf:]
"We will take the Elven Road. That
path is still safe."
[Beorn:]
Safe? The Wood-Elves of Mirkwood
are not like their kin. They're
less wise and more dangerous. But
it matters not.
CLOSE ON: Thorin looks troubled.
[Thorin:]
What do you mean?
[Beorn:]
These lands are crawling with orcs.
Their numbers are growing, and you

[Beorn:] (cont'd)
are on foot. You will never reach
the forest alive.
ANGLE ON: Beorn rises from the table. He glares down at
Thorin.
[Beorn:] (CONT'D)
I don't like dwarves. They're
greedy and blind, blind to the
lives they deem lesser than their
own.
CLOSE ON: Beorn picks up a SCAMPERING MOUSE from the table.
The dwarves watch, nervous. Beorn pets the creature.
[Beorn:] (CONT'D)
But orcs I hate more. What do you
need?
Thorin looks relieved.
118 EXT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - DAY 118
ANGLE ON: The dwarves pack their things onto Beorn's ponies.
Near the edge of the hedges, Bilbo rummages through the
dirt. He picks up an ACORN and slips it in his pocket.
Gandalf and Beorn stand further back, watching the dwarves
mount up.
[Beorn:]
You will leave my ponies before you
enter the forest.
[Gandalf:]
"You have my word."
BIRDS CAW in the distance. Gandalf looks up in suspicion.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
"We're being watched."
[Beorn:]
Yes. The orcs will not give up.
They will hunt the dwarves until
they seem them destroyed.
[Gandalf:]
"Why now? What has made Bolg crawl
from his hole?"
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 109.
118 CONTINUED: 118
[Beorn:]
There is an alliance between the
orcs of Moria and the sorcerer in
Dol Guldur.
[Gandalf:]
"Are you sure of this?"
[Beorn:]
Packs have been seen gathering
there. Each day, more and more
come.
CLOSE ON: A distant ORC SCREAM sounds from the woods. The
dwarves perk up in alarm.
[Gandalf:]
"What do you know of this sorcerer,
the one they call the Necromancer?"
[Beorn:]
I know he is not what he seems.
Fell things are drawn to his power.
Bolg pays homage to him.
[Thorin:]
Gandalf, time is wasting.
ANGLE ON: With a nod, Gandalf marches forward.
[Beorn:]
There is more.
Gandalf stops in his tracks.
[Beorn:] (CONT'D)
Not long past, word spread that the
dead had been seen walking near the
High Fells of Rhudaur.
[Gandalf:]
"The dead?"
[Beorn:]
Is it true? Are there tombs in
those mountains?
[Gandalf:]
"Yes. Yes, there are tombs up there."
CLOSE ON: Beorn seems slightly taken aback.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 110.
118 CONTINUED: (2) 118
[Beorn:]
I remember a time when a great evil
ruled these lands. One powerful
enough to raise the dead. If that
enemy has returned to Middle Earth,
I would have you tell me.
[Gandalf:]
"Saruman the White says it is not
possible. The enemy is destroyed
and will never return."
[Beorn:]
And what does Gandalf the Grey
think?
Gandalf STUTTERS, trying to think of what to say. Suddenly,
another LOUD CAW echoes across the grasslands.
[Beorn:] (CONT'D)
Go now, while you have the light.
Your hunters are not far behind.
ANGLE ON: As Gandalf mounts his pony, a WARG HOWLS. Beorn
stands alone, watching the Company ride off into the
distance.
119 EXT. ELVEN GATE - MIRKWOOD - DAY 119
WIDE ON: The Company rides rapidly across the lands. They
stop before a gloomy, forboding forest. MIRKWOOD.
ANGLE ON: Gandalf walks into the edge of the forest, passing
underneath an ANCIENT ARCHWAY.
[Gandalf:]
"The Elven Gate."
He turns to address the dwarves.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
"Here lies our path through
Mirkwood."
[Dwalin:]
No sign of the orcs, we have luck
on our side.
Gandalf looks doubtful.

119 CONTINUED: 119
WIDE ON: From a distant ridge, Beorn stands watch over them,
in his bear form.
[Gandalf:]
"Set the ponies loose. Let them
return to their master."
ANGLE ON: Bilbo and the dwarves begin to dismount and
unsaddle their ponies. Bilbo approaches the forest.
[Bilbo:]
This forest feels sick, as if a
disease lies upon it. Is there no
way around?
[Gandalf:]
"Not if we go two hundred miles
north, or twice that distance
south."
Gandalf goes deeper into the forest and comes across an IVY
COVERED STATUE. From outside the gate, Bilbo fiddles with
the Ring in his pocket.
IMAGE: Galadriel stands in Rivendell, observing the sunrise.
[Galadriel:] (V.O.)
Something moves in the shadows,
unseen, hidden from our sight.
Every day it grows in strength.
Beware the Necromancer. He is not
what he seems.
CLOSE ON: From the gate, Bilbo continues to play with the
Ring.
IMAGE: The EYE OF SAURON flickers onto the screen.
CLOSE ON: Startled, Bilbo takes his hand out of his pockets.
Gandalf yanks back the vines, revealing the Eye of Sauron
PAINTED onto the statue. The wizard stumbles back in shock.
[Galadriel:] (V.O.) (CONT'D)
If our enemy has returned, we must
know. Go to the tombs in the
mountain.
The wizard nods in agreement.

[Gandalf:]
"The High Fells. So be it."
WIDE ON: The unladen ponies trot away from the Elven Gate.
Gloin is nearly finished unsaddling Gandalf's horse when he
emerges from the forest.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
"Not my horse! I need it!"
CLOSE ON: As Gandalf strides forward, Bilbo and the dwarves
look up in surprise.
[Bilbo:]
You're not leaving us?
[Gandalf:]
"I would not do this unless I had
to."
Thorin looks deeply displeased. Gandalf stops next to Bilbo,
looking down at him with suspicion.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
"You've changed, Bilbo Baggins.
You're not the same hobbit as the
one who left the Shire."
[Bilbo:]
I was going to tell you -
...
I found something in the Goblin
Tunnels.
[Gandalf:]
"Found what?"
Gandalf leans forward, curious. Bilbo looks up at him,
STUTTERING as he fumbles with the Ring in his pocket.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
"What did you find?"
Bilbo removes his hand from his pocket.
[Bilbo:]
My courage.
[Gandalf:]
"Good. Well, that's good; you'll
need it."
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 113.
119 CONTINUED: (3) 119
ANGLE ON: Gandalf turns and begins to mount his horse.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
"I'll be waiting for you at the
overlook before the slopes of
Erebor. Keep the map and key safe.
Do not enter that mountain without
me. This is not the Greenwood of
old. The very air of the forest is
heavy with illusion. It will seek
to enter your mind and lead you
astray."
Confused, Bilbo turns to the dwarves surrounding.
[Bilbo:]
Lead us astray? What does that
mean?
A LIGHT RAIN begins to come down from the skies.
[Gandalf:]
"You must stay on the path; do not
leave it. If you do, you will never
find it again."
CLOSE ON: Gandalf climbs on top of his horse's SADDLE. He
gives the dwarves one last glance, before he rides into the
forest.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
"No matter what may come, you must
stay on the path!"
ANGLE ON: Thorin watches him leave. He turns, and leads the
company into the forest.
[Thorin:]
Come on. We must reach the mountain
before the sun sets on Durin's Day.
This is our one chance to find the
hidden door.
CRANE SHOT: The Company files into Mirkwood. PANNING UP, we
see an endless field of DARK, GLOOMY TREES spanning the
horizon.
120 EXT. ELVEN PATH - MIRKWOOD - DAY 120
ANGLE ON: The Company follows the ELVEN PATH. At one point,
Thorin brushes aside some LEAVES to see that the stones

round a corner.
[Thorin:]
The path turns this way.
Bilbo and the dwarves follow at his word.
IMAGES: The path twists and turns throughout the forest,
leading across BARE GROUND, HIGH LEDGES, and FALLEN TREE
TRUNKS.
IMAGE: Further along, Dwalin thumps his hammer onto the
ground. The metal CLUNCKS against the stone path.
[Dwalin:]
This way.
IMAGE: As the dwarves press on, they become further and
further DISORIENTATED.
[Oin:]
Air, I need air. My head, it's
swimming.
Oin looks above him. FIREFLIES flutter around his head.
Perplexed, Oin turns back to the path ahead.
121 EXT. STONE BRIDGE - MIRKWOOD - DAY 121
ANGLE ON: The dwarves cross a STONE BRIDGE leading over a
MURKY STREAM. Bilbo is the first to reach the other side.
CLOSE ON: Exhausted, Bilbo takes a seat. Thorin, holding a
BOW AND ARROW, jumps down from the bridge. He lands beside a
startled Bilbo.
Suddenly, there is a RUSTLING NOISE from the trees.
Bilbo rises, as he sees a WHITE STAG TROT into a clearing.
It SHIMMERS against the gloomy forest backdrop, like a
beacon of hope.
From beside him, Thorin slowly DRAWS HIS BOW.
[Bilbo:]
What are you doing?
Thorin and the stag locks eyes. For a moment, he seems to
hesitate.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 115.
121 CONTINUED: 121
WIDE ON: He FIRES THE ARROW nonetheless. It misses, sending
the stag running off into the woods.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
You shouldn't have done that. It's
bad luck.
CLOSE ON: Thorin shakes his head, oddly enraged.
[Thorin:]
I don't believe in luck. We make
our own luck.
122 EXT. MIRKWOOD - NIGHT 122
WIDE ON: Darkness settles in between the Mirkwood trees. The
dwarves wander the forest, aimless and exhausted.
ANGLE ON: Gloin stamps the end of his axe against the
ground. There is no sound of metal on stone.
[Kili:]
We need to take a rest.
Thorin nods in agreement, disorientated. The dwarves stop to
catch their breath. Bilbo sits beside a CLUMP OF SPIDERWEBS.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo perks up in alarm. STRANGE WHISPERS echo
around the forest.
[Bilbo:]
What is that? Those voices, can you
hear them?
[Thorin:]
I hear nothing. No wind, no birds.
He stares up at the ROOF OF LEAVES, glowing blue in the
moonlight.
[Thorin:] (CONT'D)
What hour is it?
[Dwalin:]
I do not know. I don't even know
what day it is.
[Thorin:]
This is taking too long. Too long!
Is there no end to this accursed
forest?

[Gloin:]
None that I can see. Only trees and
more trees!
Gloin looks around him, strangely panicked.
ANGLE ON: Thorin slowly walks forward, seeing something.
[Thorin:]
There! This way!
[Oin:]
But Gandalf said -
[Thorin:]
Do as I say; follow me!
The dwarves trudge forward.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo still sits beside the webs, hearing the
voices. He absentmindedly PLUCKS the webs, which VIBRATES.
The vibrations carry onto other linked webs, leading off
into the forest. Bilbo looks up, troubled.
ANGLE ON: He rises, pointing to the Elven Path behind him.
[Bilbo:]
Wait! Stop! We can't leave the
path! We must stay on the path!
No one answers.
123 EXT. MIRKWOOD - DAY 123
CLOSE ON: Bilbo and the dwarves stumble forward. Bilbo looks
down, and sees his feet WALK BACKWARDS. He looks back up,
bewildered.
Bilbo turns to Gloin walking behind him. He sees HIMSELF
staring back at him. Even more confused, Bilbo turns back
around him. He continues down the forest, his vision TILTING
and SHIFTING.
ANGLE ON: Gloin leans down and picks up a TOBACCO POUCH.
[Gloin:]
Look. A tobacco pouch. There's
dwarves in these woods.
Fili takes the pouch from Gloin. He looks surprised.

[Fili:]
Dwarves from the Blue Mountains, no
less. This one is exactly the same
as mine.
[Bilbo:]
Because it is yours. You
understand? We're going around in
circles. We are lost!
[Dwalin:]
We're not lost. We keep heading
east.
[Oin:]
But which way is east? We've lost
the sun!
The dwarves begin to BICKER INDISTINCTLY.
HIGH ANGLE: Bilbo peers up at the leaves above. A bit of
sunlight creeps through the tree canopy far above him.
[Bilbo:]
The sun. We have to find the sun.
Up there! We need to -
ANGLE ON: He turns to the dwarves. They begin to PUSH and
SHOVE one another. Thorin stands away from the others,
listening. He hears LOW WHISPERING.
[Thorin:]
What was that?
(turns to the others)
Quiet, all of you! We're being
watched.
Bilbo begins to climb the CROOKED TREES. Around him, masses
of spiderwebs are interwoven through the forest.
124 EXT. TREETOPS - MIRKWOOD - DAY 124
WIDE ON: Bilbo pops out of the MULTICOLORED TREETOPS of
Mirkwood. His head clears, as if a spell has been broken.
Bilbo LAUGHS, relieved, as BLUE BUTTERFLIES flutter around
him.
In the distance, he sees RIVERS and LAKES.
[Bilbo:]
I can see a lake! And a river.

He spots something on the horizon. THE LONELY MOUNTAIN.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
And the Lonely Mountain! We're
almost there! Can you hear me? I
know which way to go!
The dwarves do not reply.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
Hello?
From below, he can hear TREES CRACKING. The treetops RUSTLE,
as if something is approaching. Worried, Bilbo creeps below
the treeline.
125 EXT. MIRKWOOD - DAY 125
ANGLE ON: Bilbo peers below him. He steps forward, and his
feet catch on a SPIDERWEB. Bilbo falls downward, bouncing
off SEVERAL BRANCHES, SCREAMING all the while.
He lands on another branch, catching his breath. He watches
in horror as the webs part, revealing a GINORMOUS SPIDER. It
opens its fangs and HISSES, sending Bilbo to fall backwards
onto a MASSIVE SPIDERWEB.
The spider CRAWLS forward, quickly wrapping Bilbo up inside
the web.
126 EXT. MIRKWOOD - DAY - LATER 126
CLOSE ON: Wrapped up in webs, the dwarves dangle down from
tree branches. Several LARGE SPIDERS creep around them,
whispering to each other.
ANGLE ON: One particular spider tows a web-encased Bilbo
towards the dwarves. As the spider feels him up, Bilbo
slowly begins to awake. He looks up through the webs,
startled.
Bilbo manages to swing his sword, cutting through both the
web and the spider. The creature HOWLS IN PAIN, staggering
backwards. It goes flying off of the branch, dead.
Bilbo rips off the web cocoon and rises. He sees the dwarves
and the spiders surrounding them. Carefully, Bilbo creeps
behind a tree trunk and slips on his Ring.
CLOSE ON: He is transported into the blurry Ring World once
again. The spiders' whispering ECHOES around him.

SPIDER #1
Kill them, kill them now!
SPIDER #2
Eat them now, wet and runny!
SPIDER #3
Their hide is tough! There's good
juice inside!
SPIDER #1
Stick it again! Stick it again!
Finish it off!
ANGLE ON: The spiders approach Gloin, wrapped in his own
web-cacoon. He springs to life, kicking against the GLOSSY
WEBS. He can't do much.
SPIDER #4
Ah! The meat's alive and kicking!
SPIDER #1
Kill them now! Kill them now!
SPIDER #2
Feast! Feast! Feast!
All of the spiders take up the chant, circling around the
dwarf. Bilbo steps forward, and grabs a PIECE OF WOOD from
the trees.
He throws it into the woods below. The spiders perk up,
distracted. They all rush together towards the source of the
noise.
SPIDER #3
What is it? What is it? Kill it!
Feast!
One spider stays behind, preparing to eat Gloin. The dwarf
KICKS and WAILS against the spider.
SPIDER #2
Fat and juicy! Just a little taste!
Invisible, Bilbo sneaks up and strikes his sword against the
spider's rear. The spider spins around and HISSES, but Bilbo
still hacks away at the creature.
SPIDER #2 (CONT'D)
Curses! Where is it? Where is it?

CLOSE ON: With a grin, Bilbo slips off the Ring.
[Bilbo:]
Here.
Bilbo drives his sword into the spider's head. It WHIMPERS.
SPIDER #2
It stings! Stings! Stings!
ANGLE ON: Bilbo pulls out his sword, sending the spider
crashing to the ground. Bilbo examines his sword.
[Bilbo:]
Sting. That's a good name.
He looks to where the other dwarves are wrapped up.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
Sting.
Bilbo walks forward, using Sting to cut down the dwarves
from their branches.
CLOSE ON: They land on the forest floor, and proceed to rip
off their wrappings, CURSING and YELLING. Fili emerges from
his cacoon, PANICKED.
[Fili:]
Where's Bilbo?
Bilbo peers down at the dwarves, waving.
[Bilbo:]
I'm up here!
Suddenly, a spider jumps at Bilbo from underneath the
branch.
ANGLE ON: The hobbit falls backwards, and the spider pins
him to the ground. Bilbo manage to raise his sword, and
stabs the spider through the belly.
The spider begins to fall off the branch. Entangled in its
legs, Bilbo falls with it, SCREAMING all the while. As they
fall, the Ring slips out of Bilbo's grasp.
He lands on the LEAF COVERED GROUND and begins to search for
the Ring, desperate.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 121.
126 CONTINUED: (3) 126
The dwarves begin to rush out of their web cacoons,
brandishing weapons. DOZENS OF SPIDERS approach the Company.
They HISS and SNARL as they creep forward.
The dwarves begin to hack away at the army of spiders. Left
and right, the dead fall to the ground. Oin is knocked to
the ground by one spider. It looms over him, ready to feast.
[Dwalin:]
Grab a leg!
Dwalin leads the others towards the spider. Each dwarf grabs
one or two legs and PULLS. The legs PLOP off of the spider's
body. Dismembered, the spider falls on top of Oin, dead.
CLOSE ON: Further off, Bilbo continues to search for the
Ring. He seems greatly distressed. Panicked.
[Bilbo:]
Where is it? Where is it? Where is
it?
He freezes. Slowly, Bilbo looks over his shoulder.
WIDE ON: The Ring lies on the nearby ground, unstained and
untarnished by the MUD and DIRT.
ANGLE ON: Relieved, Bilbo steps forward.
Suddenly, a SMALL, PALE SPIDER emerges from the ground. The
spider pushes the Ring aside as it crawls forward.
Bilbo looks at the spider, infuriated. He raises Sting high
above his head, and runs forward with a YELL.
He hacks and slashes away at the spider. The spider falls to
the ground, dead. Still, Bilbo slices away, berserk. He cuts
away legs, feelers, and more. Finally, he jumps and sends
the sword down into the spider's head.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo catches his breath, staring down at the
Ring. He picks it up, holding the Ring beside his face.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
Mine.
Satisfied, Bilbo sits next to the dead spider. He examines
the Ring, turning it forwards and backwards in his hands.
Finally, what he has just done dawns on Bilbo. Disgusted,
Bilbo looks at the spiderwebs and gore covering him.

SHOUTING sounds from the distance.
ANGLE ON: The dwarves are killing off the last of the
spiders. Their swords rise and fall, slicing away legs and
digging into brains. Thorin pauses amongst the chaos,
looking up at the treetops.
Above them, a BLONDE ELF runs through the branches. He grabs
onto SPIDER SILK, sliding down to the ground. The elf lands
on the ground, sliding towards the dwarves. As he moves, he
kills the spiders around him.
Finally, the elf comes to a halt. He points an arrow at
Thorin, revealing him to be -
[Legolas:]
Do not think I won't kill you
dwarf. It would be my pleasure.
[Legolas:] GREENLEAF.
WIDE ON: DOZENS OF WOODLAND ELVES encircle the Company, bows
drawn. Legolas turns to the others.
[Legolas:] (CONT'D)
Search them!
ANGLE ON: The elves begin to riffle through the dwarves'
coats and pockets. One elf, TAURIEL, stands over Fili,
confiscating his MANY KNIVES.
CLOSE ON: Legolas pulls an AMULET from Gloin's beard.
[Gloin:]
Give it back! That's private!
Legolas sees a picture of a dwarf inside.
[Legolas:]
Who is this? Your brother?
[Gloin:]
That is my wife.
Legolas looks at the other picture. A picture of a dwarf
child.
[Legolas:]
And what is this horrid creature? A
goblin mutant?

[Gloin:]
That's my wee lad, Gimli.
Legolas raises his eyebrow in contempt. Tauriel steps
towards Legolas, carrying several of Fili's knives.
[Legolas:]
(in Elvish; subtitled)
Are the spiders dead?
TAURIEL
(in Elvish; subtitled)
Yes, but more will come. They're
growing bolder.
Legolas looks only vaguely troubled. An elf steps forward,
handing Legolas Thorin's sword, Orcrist.
[Legolas:]
(in Elvish; subtitled)
This is an ancient Elvish blade.
Forged by my kin.
(in the Common Tongue)
Where did you get this?
ANGLE ON: He points the sword towards Thorin.
[Thorin:]
It was given to me.
[Legolas:]
Not just a thief, but a liar as
well.
Legolas shouts a command to the other elves. They begin to
lead the dwarves out of the forest.
CLOSE ON: As they walk, Fili looks to Thorin, troubled.
[Fili:]
Where's Bilbo?
Thorin scans the forest. There is no sign of Bilbo.
127 EXT. GATES - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 127
WIDE ON: The dwarves are led over a bridge and through the
gates. Their CHAINS JINGLE as they walk into the WOODLAND
REALM.

Invisible, Bilbo rushes forward. Legolas pauses, looking
behind him. He sees nothing. He turns and walks into the
gate. The elf guard closes it behind him. Bilbo manages to
slip in at the last moment.
128 INT. WOODLAND REALM - DAY 128
WIDE ON: The dwarves are led through the wooden walkways of
the Woodland Realm. The entire place is built out of TREE
ROOTS in a SUBTERRANEAN CAVERN.
INTERCUT:
129 INT. THRONE ROOM - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 129
TEASING SHOTS: The Elvenking, THRANDUIL, sits on his wooden
throne. He stares, INTENSE, at the dwarves as they are led
into his kingdom.
130 INT. ELVEN CELLS - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 130
ANGLE ON: The dwarves are pushed into several cells. The
dwarves SHOUT AND PROTEST through the metal bars.
[Dwalin:]
This is not the end of it! Do you
hear me?
[Gloin:]
Let us out of here!
An elf inspects Fili once again, and finds another large
knife in his coat. Fili SIGHS IN FRUSTRATION as he is
dragged into his cell.
CLOSE ON: Fili watches from his cell. Tauriel begins to
close the door.
[Kili:]
Aren't you going to search me? I
could have anything down my
trousers.
TAURIEL
Or nothing.
She slams the door in his face.

THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 125.

ANGLE ON: The elves file out of the corridor.
Several dwarves begin to throw themselves against the cell
doors, GRUNTING in their effort. Balin shakes his head.
[Balin:]
Leave it! There's no way out! This
is no Orc dungeon; these are the
halls of the Woodland Realm. No one
leaves here but by the king's
consent.
Disappointed, the dwarves sit and sulk in their cells.
131 INT. THRONE ROOM - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 131
WIDE ON: Thorin stands before King Thranduil. The Elvenking
circle around the dwarf, glaring down at him.
THRANDUIL
Some may imagine that a noble quest
is at hand. A quest to reclaim a
homeland and slay a dragon. I
myself suspect a more prosaic
motive: attempted burglary, or
something of that ilk.
CLOSE ON: Thranduil looks closely at Thorin.
THRANDUIL (CONT'D)
You have found a way in. You seek
that which would bestow upon you
the right to rule: The King's
Jewel. The Arkenstone. It is
precious to you and your people
beyond measure. I understand that.
There are gems in the mountain that
I too desire. White gems of pure
starlight. I offer you my help.
[Thorin:]
I am listening.
THRANDUIL
I will let you go if you but return
what is mine.
ANGLE ON: Thorin begins to pace up and down the throne room.
He seems amused.

[Thorin:]
A favor for a favor.
THRANDUIL
You have my word. One king to
another.
[Thorin:]
I would not trust Thranduil, the
great king, to honor his word,
should the end of all days be upon
us!
Enraged, Thorin spins around and points to Thranduil.
[Thorin:] (CONT'D)
You lack all honor! I have seen how
you treat your friends! We came to
you once, starving, homeless,
seeking your help, but you turned
your back. You turned away from the
suffering of my people and the
inferno that destroyed us!
(in Dwarvish)
Die a death of flames!
CLOSE ON: Infuriated, Thranduil leans forward. He and Thorin
are nose to nose.
THRANDUIL
Do not speak to me of dragon fire.
I know its wrath and ruin.
Suddenly, Thranduil's face contorts, revealing hidden BURNS
and SCARS. Thorin looks surprised.
THRANDUIL (CONT'D)
I have faced the great serpents of
the north.
ANGLE ON: He draws away, his face returning to normal.
THRANDUIL (CONT'D)
I warned your grandfather of what
his greed would summon, but he
would not listen. You are just like
him.
Thranduil motions to the guards. They begin to drag Thorin
away, as Thranduil returns to his throne.

THRANDUIL (CONT'D)
Stay here if you will, and rot. A
hundred years is a mere blink in
the life of an elf. I am patient. I
can wait.
132 INT. ELVEN CELLS - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 132
CLOSE ON: Thorin is thrown into a cell. The guards walk of
with a pair of JANGLING KEYS.
ANGLE ON: Balin rises in his cell across the hall.
[Balin:]
Did he offer you a deal?
[Thorin:]
I told him he could go die a death
of fire. Him and all his kin!
[Balin:]
Well, that's that then. The deal
was our only hope.
[Thorin:]
Not our only hope.
CLOSE ON: Thorin peers out of his cell, hopeful.
133 INT. THRANDUIL'S CHAMBERS - WOODLAND REALM - NIGHT 133
Bilbo, still invisible, peeks out behind a column. He steps
into the room. Thranduil steps out from a corner.
THRANDUIL
I know you're there. Why do you
linger in the shadows?
Bilbo freezes.
TAURIEL
I was coming to report to you.
ANGLE ON: Tauriel steps out of the staircase behind him.
Bilbo is greatly relieved.
THRANDUIL
I thought I ordered that nest to be
destroyed not two moons past.

THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 128.
133 CONTINUED: 133
TAURIEL
We cleared the forest as ordered,
my lord, but more spiders keep
coming up from the south. They are
spawning in the ruins of Dol
Guldur, if we could kill them at
their source.
THRANDUIL
That fortress lies beyond our
borders. Keep our lands clear of
those foul creatures, that is your
task.
TAURIEL
But will they not spread to other
lands?
THRANDUIL
Other lands are not my concern. The
fortunes of the world may rise and
fall, yet here in this kingdom, we
will endure.
Bilbo scuffles out of the chamber. Thranduil looks his way,
suspicious. Tauriel bows, and leaves Thranduil to himself.
134 INT. WINE CELLAR - WOODLAND REALM - NIGHT 134
Bilbo sneaks into the wine cellar. Elves are tying EMPTY
BARRELS together. ELROS approaches them, carrying a RING OF
DUNGEON KEYS in his hands.
ELROS
These empty barrels should have
been sent back to Esgaroth hours
ago. The bargeman will be waiting
for them.
A DRUNK ELF stumbles forward.
DRUNK ELF
Say what you like about our ill
tempered king and his excellent
taste in wine. Come, Elros, try it.
ELROS
I have the dwarves in my charge.

DRUNK ELF
They're locked up, where can they

The drunk elf takes the keys from Elros and hangs them on a
HOOK ON THE WALL. Bilbo takes note of the hanging keys.
135 EXT. HILLSIDE - RHUDAUR - DAY 135
WIDE ON: Gandalf carefully ventures up a STEEP HILLSIDE. In
the distance, STONE CLIFFS rise past the horizon.
136 EXT. CLIFFS - RHUDAUR - DAY 136
Gandalf climbs a narrow, stone STAIRCASE built into the side
of the tall, bare mountain. Just as he reaches a DOORWAY
carved into the rock, the step beneath him GIVES WAY.
Quickly, Gandalf catches himself and climbs onto the DOORWAY
entrance.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf holds onto a set of INTERLOCKING METAL
BARS bent away from the doorway. Long ago, they had covered
the entrance.
Cautious, Gandalf steps inside.
137 INT. HIGH FELLS - RHUDAUR - DAY 137
ANGLE ON: Suddenly, he is grabbed by some INVISIBLE FORCE
and pulled through a SHORT TUNNEL in the mountain.
He comes to a halt at the end of the tunnel, which leads
into a VAST and CAVERNOUS HOLLOW. Catching his breath,
Gandalf peers over the edge of the ledge. A DARK, EMPTY PIT
lies below, leading into some unknown darkness.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf cradles the top of his staff in his hand
and BLOWS. The staff begins to GLOW WHITE.
ANGLE ON: With this light, he examines his surroundings. On
the far wall, he sees METAL BARS torn away from another
doorway. The doorway of a CRYPT.
Slowly, he steps forward on NARROW STONES set in the side of
the cavern. He reaches the crypt doorway and steps inside.
138 INT. CRYPT - HIGH FELLS - DAY 138
CLOSE ON: Gandalf finds a CRUMBLED TOMB inside the ancient
crypt. Slowly, he approaches it, using the light of his

staff as a guide.
Suddenly, TWO BIRDS fly out of the broken tomb. Gandalf
gives a start, turning to look behind him. Radagast stands
at the crypt entrance.
[Gandalf:]
"Oh, it's you!"
[Radagast:]
Why am I here, Gandalf?
[Gandalf:]
"Trust me, Radagast, I would not
have called you here without good
reason."
Radagast removes his hat, letting the birds settle into the
nest lying on top of his head. Radagast replaces the hat,
looking hard at the surrounding crypt.
[Radagast:]
This is not a nice place to meet.
[Gandalf:]
"No, it is not."
139 INT. HIGH FELLS - RHUDAUR - DAY 139
ANGLE ON: Gandalf and Radagast step out of the crypt,
examining the RUNES surrounding the doorway.
[Radagast:]
These are dark spells, Gandalf; old
and full of hate. Who's burried
here?
[Gandalf:]
"If he had a name, it's long since
been lost. He would have only been
known as a servant of evil. One of
a number. One of nine."
With his staff, Gandalf illuminates the cavern below. EIGHT
OTHER CRYPTS lie below, their metal bars BENT and BROKEN
AWAY.
140 EXT. HILLTOP - RHUDAUR - DAY 140

in their business.

[Radagast:]
Why now, Gandalf? I don't
understand.
[Gandalf:]
"The Ringwraiths have been summouned
to Dol Guldur."
[Radagast:]
But it cannot be the Necromancer. A
human sorcerer could not summon
such evil.
[Gandalf:]
"Who said it was human?"
ANGLE ON: Radagast stops abruptly.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
"The Nine only answer to one master.
We've been blind, Radagast, and in
our blindness, the enemy has
returned."
CLOSE ON: Radagast looks shocked.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
"He is summoning his servants. Bolg
of the North is no ordinary hunter.
He is a commander, a commander of
legions. The enemy is preparing for
war. It will begin in the east. His
mind is set upon that mountain."
ANGLE ON: Gandalf turns and begins to walk down the hill.
Radagast follows behind him.
[Radagast:]
Where are you going?
[Gandalf:]
"To rejoin the others!"
[Radagast:]
Gandalf!
Gandalf looks back to Radagast, earnest.
[Gandalf:]
"I started this; I cannot forsake
them. They are all in grave danger."

141 INT. ELVEN CELLS - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 141
WIDE ON: Sunlight filters in through the prison corridor.
[Fili:]
I'll wager the sun is on the rise.
It must be nearly dawn.
CLOSE ON: Kili stands behind his cell door, looking
defeated.
[Kili:]
We're never going to reach the
mountain are we?
Bilbo emerges in front of the cell, holding up the ring of
keys.
[Bilbo:]
Not stuck in here you're not!
The other dwarves spring to their doors. They EXCLAIM in
surprise.
[Balin:]
Bilbo!
[Bilbo:]
Shush! There are guards nearby!
Bilbo unlocks Thorin's door. Thorin looks impressed as Bilbo
goes to the other cells and unlocks the rest of them.
ANGLE ON: The dwarves begin to walk up some stairs.
[Dwalin:]
The stairs! You first!

Bilbo leads the dwarves down another flight of stairs,
leading to the cellars.
142 INT. WINE CELLAR - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 142
CLOSE ON: Elros and the others SNORE from a table. FOOD is
scattered around the table, and GOBLETS OF WINE are clutched
in their hands.
The dwarves look in disbelief to Bilbo.
[Kili:]
I don't believe it; we're in the
cellars!
[Gloin:]
You're supposed to be leading us
out, not further in!

I know what I'm doing. This way,

[Bilbo:]
Everyone, climb into the barrels!
Quickly!
[Dwalin:]
Are you mad? They'll find us!
[Bilbo:]
No, no, they won't, I promise you.
Please, please, you must trust me!
The dwarves mill around, indecisive. Thorin and Bilbo
exchange glances. He turns to the others.

THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 134.
144 CONTINUED: 144
[Thorin:]
Do as he says.
Without question, the dwarves begin to climb into the
barrels, hardly able to fit inside. Fili pops his head out
of his barrel.
[Fili:]
What do we do now?
Bilbo stands beside a LARGE LEVER.
[Bilbo:]
Hold your breath.
[Fili:]
Hold my breath? What do you mean?
Bilbo furiously pulls on the lever and floor beneath the
barrels OPENS UP. The dwarves are sent into the river below
with a SPLASH. The floor closes behind them. Bilbo stands
beside the lever, triumphant.
CLOSE ON: The elves begin to wake from their stupor, hearing
the TUMBLING NOISE. Bilbo looks deeply troubled.
145 INT. ELVEN CELLS - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 145

the elven guards.
TAURIEL
Where is the keeper of the keys?

Bilbo stomps against the trap door, frantic. The elves rise
from the table.

OF STAIRS. The cellar is seen in the distance.
148 INT. WINE CELLAR - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 148
CLOSE ON: Bilbo looks up, seeing Tauriel and the other
elves.
ANGLE ON: He quickly shuffles backwards, tipping the floor
back. With a SCREAM, he falls into the river below.

149 EXT. FOREST RIVER - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 149
CLOSE ON: Bilbo surfaces from under the water. He quickly
grabs onto Oin's barrel.
[Thorin:]
Well done, Master Baggins.
Bilbo holds up his hand in thanks. Thorin turns to the other
dwarves.
[Thorin:]
Come on, let's go!
ANGLE ON: The dwarves paddle with their hands as the river
pulls the barrels along.
150 INT. WOODLAND REALM - DAY 150

Through the tree roots far below them, the dwarves are seen
floating along.
151 EXT. FOREST RIVER - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 151

WATERFALL lies in their path.
[Thorin:]
Hold on!
CLOSE ON: Bilbo and the dwarves plunge through the rapids,
half drowned.
WIDE ON: The barrels bump into one another as they bob down
the RAGING RIVER.
152 EXT. GATEWAY - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 152

spot the dwarves in the distance. Legolas turns to Elros.
[Legolas:]

Shut the gate.
As Legolas races back inside, Elros pulls out a HORN. He
blows, sending a LOUD BLAST OF SOUND.
153 EXT. FOREST RIVER - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 153
The dwarves round a corner in the river. A STONE GUARDPOST
is built above the river, an open SLUICE GATE underneath.

elves pull a LEVER, closing the sluice gate.
[Thorin:]
No!
The barrels come to a stop before the gate. Thorin grabs
onto the grate and pushes against it, DESPERATE as the other
barrels pile up.
ANGLE ON: The elves draw out their swords, ready to spring
into action.
Suddenly, an elf is shot in the back. He falls forward,
revealing an ORC crouched behind him. The orc SNARLS,
leading a TROOP OF ORCS onto the guardpost. They wipe out
the other elves.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo and the dwarves look up, surprised. The dead
elves begin to fall into the water.
[Fili:]
Watch out! There's orcs!
ANGLE ON: From the riverbank, a MULTITUDE OF ORCS run out of
the bushes, led by Bolg.
BOLG
(in Black Speech;
subtitled)
Slay them all!
Orcs begin to throw themselves at the dwarves. Bilbo kills
several with Sting. The dwarves take the Orcish weapons,
using them to fend off the hoard of orcs.
CLOSE ON: Kili looks up, noticing the lever from above. He
gets out of his barrel and runs toward the lever.
[Dwalin:]
Kili!
ANGLE ON: Dwalin throws Kili and ORC SWORD. Kili catches it,
cutting down orcs as he makes for the lever.
From the riverbank, ELVES have begun to come onto the scene.
Bolg crushes them with his MACE. Just then, he notices Kili
on the guardspost. Bolg pulls out a LARGE BOW, and readies
an arrow.

Kili reaches the lever. Suddenly, an arrow comes pelting
towards him. Ducking, he dodges the arrow and pulls the
lever.
WIDE ON: The sluice opens, letting the dwarves sail out into
the wild river.
From the riverbank, Bolg fires another arrow.
ANGLE ON: Kili dodges once again. Bolg fires a third arrow.
Kili expertly dodges for the third time. He jumps into his
barrel, floating down the forest river.
CLOSE ON: Bolg watches the dwarves sail away.
BOLG
(in Black Speech;
subtitled)
After them!
ANGLE ON: The orcs rush forward, following the river on
land.
The dwarves attempt to steer through the river to no avail.
The river is far too RAPID. They BOB UP AND DOWN the river,
waves crashing over them.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo hangs onto Oin's barrel for dear life,
COUGHING and SPLUTTERING all the while.
WIDE ON: Orcs from either side of the riverbank fire ARROW
AFTER ARROW at the Company.
Bilbo and the dwarves reach yet another waterfall. Water
SPLASHES OVER THEM. They reach the surface, nearly drowned.
Their eyes, ears and mouths FILLED WITH WATER.
ANGLE ON: From the guardpost, Tauriel and Legolas cut down
the orcs. Left and right, SLUMPED BODIES fall into the
river.
WIDE ON: The two elves jump over the guardpost, landing onto
the riverbank. Weapons raised, they race after Bolg and his
orcs.
CLOSE ON: An orc leaps out at Thorin. Thorin slices the orc
away, and continues to speed down in the river.
ANGLE ON: Legolas and Tauriel draw out their bows. They take
out the ORC ARCHERS, never needing more than one arrow for
each orc. Other elves dart along the riverbank, fighting

without mercy.
As the dwarves twist and turn down the river, dead orcs fall
into the river beside them. One orc makes to leap after
Balin from an OVERHANGING TREE BRANCH.
Mid-jump, Thorin throws his sword, pinning the orc to the
branch.
As they continue sailing down the river, the dwarves toss
weapons to one another, taking out an orc here and there.
An orc jumps forward and grabs onto Dwalin's barrel. He
headbutts the orc, sending it flying backwards. Dwalin
manages to catch its weapon. A STEEL AXE.
ANOTHER OVERHANGING BRANCH looms above them, this time with
nearly A DOZEN ORCS crouched on top.
[Thorin:]
Cut the log!
Each passing dwarf cuts against the branch, until finally
Dwalin gives a MIGHTY SWING. The log breaks apart, falling
into the treacherous river.
An orc armed with a JAVELIN springs into the river. He leaps
onto Gloin's barrel, digging the javelin into the wood. They
go through a SMALL WATERFALL, sending the orc toppling
backwards.
Gloin's barrel sails above him. The tip of the javelin rips
through the orc, who crashes onto a rock. Gloin's barrel
flies through the air, flips over a log, and finally
SPLASHES back into the water.
WIDE ON: The elves have caught up with the dwarves. They
fight beside them on the riverbank, sending a multitude of
dead orcs spiraling down into the river.
ANGLE ON: Legolas jumps over the river, his two feet landing
on the heads of Fili and Dwalin.
He sails down the river with this vantage point, shooting
down orcs on both sides of the river. Aiming carefully, he
manages to skewer two orcs with the SAME ARROW.
Satisfied, he leaps forward and lands on the riverbank. He
slides down the hillside, using a dead orc as a board.
Legolas strides across the river again, using the dwarves as
stepping stones.

He reaches the top of the riverbank, fighting off the last
remaining orcs. From behind him, an orc stealthily.
From the river, Thorin throws his sword. It cuts down the
orc behind Legolas. Legolas locks eyes with him, surprised.
Thorin scowls over at him, until he and the dwarves round a
corner. They are out of Thranduil's lands.
WIDE ON: Bolg and the last dozen orcs race after the
dwarves.
BOLG
(in Black Speech;
subtitled)
After them! Cut them off!
CLOSE ON: Legolas stares after the orcs, WEIGHING THE RISK.
Finally, he turns and heads back to the Woodland Realm.
154 EXT. STONY SHORE - FOREST RIVER - DAY 154
WIDE ON: The dwarves paddle through the now calm waters of
the river. A SLAB OF ROCK juts out of the water nearby.
[Thorin:]
Anything behind us?
[Balin:]
Not that I can see.
[Fili:]
I think we've outrun the orcs.
[Thorin:]
Not for long. We've lost the
current.
[Oin:]
Gloin is half drowned.
[Thorin:]
Make for the shore! Come, let's go!
ANGLE ON: The dwarves climb onto the rocky shore. Kili falls
to his feet, exhausted.
[Thorin:]
On your feet.
[Fili:]
Can't we rest?
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 140.
154 CONTINUED: 154
[Thorin:]
There's an orc pack on our tail. We
keep moving.
[Balin:]
To where?
[Bilbo:]
The mountain, we're so close.
[Balin:]
A lake lies between us and that
mountain. We have no way to cross
it.
[Bilbo:]
So then we go around.
[Dwalin:]
The orcs will run us down, as sure
as daylight. We have no weapons to
defend ourselves.
CLOSE ON: Thorin nods, troubled. He turns to Fili.
[Thorin:]
Fili, you have two minutes.
ANGLE ON: Relieved, Fili empties his water-filled boot into
the river. Slowly, a BOWMAN steps forward on the rocks above
the Company. He raises his bow, aiming towards Fili.
The dwarves look up, startled. Dwalin steps in front of
Fili, holding out a BRANCH in front of him. He GROWLS.
The Bowman fires the arrow, which lands straight in the
branch. Kili raises a rock above his head, but the Bowman
shoots it out of his hand.
[Bowman:]
Do it again, and you're dead.
Balin looks past the man, seeing a BARGE tethered into a
near DOCK. He approaches the Bowman, arms raised.
[Balin:]
Excuse me, but you're from
Laketown, if I'm not mistaken? That
barge over there, it wouldn't be
available for hire, by any chance?
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 141.

The Bowman lowers his bow.
