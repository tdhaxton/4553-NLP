[TITLE:  THE LORD OF THE RINGS]



[Camera pans over the Misty Mountainsas voices drift in from the background.]

[Gandalf:]
"You cannot pass!"

[Frodo:]
Gandalf!

[Gandalf:]
"I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielderof the Flame of Anor!"
[Camera pans closer to the mountainside.]
[Gandalf:]
"Argh! Go back to the shadow. The DarkFire will not avail you, Flame of Ud n![Camera zooms in through the mountainand focuses on Gandalf and the Balrogon the bridge of Khazad-d m. The Balrogstrikes down on Gandalf with its flamingsword. Gandalf parries the blow withGlamdring, shattering the Balrog s sword.]YOU  SHALL NOT... PASS!!!"
[Gandalf strikes his staff onto thebridge. As the Balrog steps forward,the bridge collapses from under it andthe demon plunges backward into thechasm. Gandalf, exhausted, leans onhis staff and watches the Balrog fallthen turns to follow the others. Atthe last minute, the flaming whip lashesup from the depths of the abyss andwinds around Gandalf s ankle, dragginghim over the edge. He clings onto thebridge but is straining to keep hisgrip.]
[Gandalf:]
"Argh!"

[Frodo rushes forward but Boromir restrainshim.]
[Boromir:]
No! No!

[Frodo:]
Gandalf!

[Gandalf:]
"Fly, you fools!"

[Gandalf loses his grip and falls intothe chasm]
[Frodo:]
Noooooooooooooooo!!!!

[Gandalf loses his grip and falls intothe chasm]
[Frodo:]
[Calls after Gandalf as he falls intothe abyss] Gaaandaaaaalf!!
[Gandalf falls after the Balrog andgrabs hold of his sword Glamdring onhis way down. As they continue to plungeinto the depths, Gandalf hacks awayat the Balrog even as it thrashes andbounces off the walls. They continueto plunge at great speed, sometimeswith Gandalf clinging to the horn ofthe demon. The battling pair then fallsinto an enormous cavern and plungesinto the water. Just then Frodo awakensas if from a nightmare.]
[Frodo:]
Gandalf!

[Sam:]
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

[Frodo:]
Nothing. Just a dream. [Lies back down.]

[Frodo and Sam climbs over the rockyterrain Emyn Muil. They look into thedistance at the Mountain of Fire.]

[Sam:]
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earthwe don t want to see any closer, andthe one place we re trying to get to.It s just where we can t get. Let sface it, Mr. Frodo, we re lost. I don tthink Gandalf meant for us to come thisway.
[Frodo:]
He didn t mean for a lot of things tohappen, Sam... but they did.
[Suddenly Frodo feels and sees the Eyezooming in on him. He gasps and pantsas he backs away.]
[Sam:]
Mr. Frodo? It s the Ring, isn t it?

[Frodo:]
It s getting heavier. [Clutches theRing by his chest and sits down, stillpanting. He then fumbles for his waterbottle and takes a sip.]
[Frodo:]
What food have we got left?

[Sam:]
Well, let me see. [He takes out a packageof lembas bread from his pack] Oh yes,lovely   Lembas bread. And look! [Hedigs deeper into his pack] More lembasbread.
[Sam shows another package. He thenbreaks off a piece and tosses it toFrodo, and munches on a piece himself.]

[Sam:]
I don't usually hold with foreign food,but this Elvish stuff, it s not bad.

[Frodo:]
[smiles] Nothing ever dampens your spirits,does it Sam?
[Sam smiles back, and then looks ominouslytowards Mordor.]
[Sam:]
Those rain clouds might.

[They continue trekking through difficultterrain, often huddling underneath theircloaks.]
[Sam:]
[Looks around] This looks strangelyfamiliar.
[Frodo:]
[Exasperated] It s because we ve beenhere before! We re going in circles.

[Sam:]
Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrantthere's a nasty bog nearby. Can yousmell it?
[Frodo:]
Yes. I can smell it. [Drops to a whisper]We re not alone.
[NIGHTTIME
Frodo and Sam are sleeping. A dark shapeappears on top of the cliff. The creatureGollum has appeared and is making hisway down to the hobbits.]
[Gollum:]
The thieves! The thieves! The filthylittle thieves! Where is it? Where isssit? They stole it from us. My preciousss.[Gollum creeps closer and closer.] Cursethem! We hates them! It s ours, it is...and we wantssss it!
[Gollum reaches out his hand towardsthe hobbits. Suddenly the hobbits springup, grab hold of Gollum s arms and pullhim down. Amidst the struggle, Gollumwriggles loose and leaps onto Frodo.As Frodo falls back, the chain and Ringaround his neck is revealed and Gollumjumps straight for the Ring. Sam triesto grab at him but is knocked away.Gollum now jumps on top of Frodo andtries to reach for the Ring even asFrodo grabs his hands and tries to pushhim away. Gollum s cheeks puff withexertion as he struggles with Frodo,his enormous eyes fixed on the Ring.Sam grabs hold of Gollum again and tearshim away from Frodo. Gollum then turnsaround and bites Sam on the shoulder,wriggles around and clasps his armsaround Sam s neck and legs around hiswaist in a death grip. Frodo unsheathesSting and holds it to Gollum's throat.]

[Frodo:]
[menacingly] This is Sting. You've seenit before, haven t you... Gollum! Releasehim or I ll cut your throat!
[Slowly, Gollum loosens his grip onSam and as the latter disentangles himself,Gollum wails. In the next scene, Gollumis being dragged with Sam's Elvish ropearound his neck, wailing and writhingin pain.]
[Gollum:]
It burns! It burns us! It freezes! NastyElves twisted it. Take it off us!

[Sam:]
Quiet you!

[Sam tugs fiercely at the rope. Gollumcries some more and collapses onto hisback. Sam turns to Frodo in dismay.]

[Sam:]
It s hopeless! Every Orc in Mordor sgoing to hear this racket! Let s justtie him up and leave him.
[Gollum:]
No! That would kill us! Kill us!

[Sam:]
It s no more than you deserve!

[Frodo:]
Maybe he does deserve to die, but nowthat I see him, I do pity him.
[Gollum:]
[Begging] We be nice to them if theybe nice to us. Take it off us. We swearsto do what you wants. We swears.
[Frodo:]
There s no promise you can make thatI can trust.
[Gollum:]
We swears to serve the master of thepreciousss. We swears on... on the precious.*Gollum. Gollum.*
[Frodo:]
The Ring is treacherous. It will holdyou to your word.
[Gollum:]
Yes... on the preciousss. On the preciousss.

[Sam:]
I don t believe you! [Gollum backs away,frightened, and climbs onto a boulder]Get down! I said, down!
[Sam jerks strongly at the rope as Gollumtries to get away from him. He crashesonto the ground, choking.]
[Frodo:]
Sam!

[Sam:]
He s trying to trick us! We let himgo he'll throttle us in our sleep!

[Gollum lies panting and holding histhroat. He backs away, frightened, asFrodo approaches him.]
[Frodo:]
You know the way to Mordor?

[Gollum:]
[nods warily] Yes...

[Frodo:]
You've been there before?

[Gollum:]
[nods again] Yes...

[Frodo reaches out and takes the ropenoose off Gollum s neck. Gollum seemssurprised and relieved.]
[Frodo:]
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

[Gollum scrambles off in the directionof Morannon and the hobbits follow inhis wake.]


[A band of Uruk-hai marches across theplain, with two hobbits bound to thebacks of two Uruk-hai. Pippin triesto call to Merry, who is unconsciouswith a gash on his right brow.]
[Pippin:]
Merry. Merry! [He receives no response.]

[Suddenly, an Uruk-hai puts up his handand signals a stop.]
UGL K
What is it? What do you smell?

MAN-FLESH URUK
[sniffs the air] Man-flesh.

[Pippin:]
[quietly to himself] Aragorn!

UGL K
They've picked up our trail! Let's move!

[The Uruk-hai quicken their pace. Pippinstruggles to reach his Elven broochwith his teeth. He then tears it offhis cloak and drops it onto the ground.A foot stomps onto the brooch but itremains unbroken and visible on thegrass.]
[Aragorn is lying with his eyes closedand ear pressed to the ground, listeningfor the sound of footsteps.]
[Aragorn:]
Their pace has quickened. [He looksup.] They must have caught our scent.Hurry! [He runs off.]
[Legolas:]
Come on, Gimli! [Looks back at Gimliand then runs after Aragorn]
[Gimli:]
[pauses in his steps and huffs] Threedays  and nights  pursuit. No food.No rest. And no sign of our quarry butwhat bare rock can tell. [Runs afterhis companions.]
[The Three Hunters run across rocksand plains, with Aragorn in the lead,followed by Legolas and Gimli. Fromtime to time, Legolas looks back tomake sure that Gimli is keeping up.Aragorn suddenly bends down to pickup an Elven brooch from the ground.]

[Aragorn:]
Not idly do the leaves of L rien fall.

[Legolas:]
[stops and turns to Aragorn.] They mayyet be alive.
[Aragorn:]
Less than a day ahead of us. Come! [Runsoff again]
[Gimli stumbles from behind some rocksand rolls to the ground]
[Legolas:]
Come, Gimli! We are gaining on them!

[Gimli:]
[Panting] I am wasted on cross-country!We dwarves are natural sprinters! Verydangerous over short distances!
[The trackers come over a hill and pauseas they gaze across the plains below.]


[Aragorn:]
Rohan. Home of the horse-lords. Thereis something strange at work here. Someevil gives speed to these creatures,sets its will against us.
[Legolas runs ahead and looks out tothe horizon.]
[Aragorn:]
Legolas, what do your Elf eyes see?

[Legolas:]
The Uruks turn northeast. They re takingthe hobbits to Isengard!
[Aragorn:]
Saruman.



[The tower of Orthanc stands amidstthe smoking caverns of Isengard. Sarumanstands in his chamber, communicatingwith the Dark Lord through the Palant r.]

[Saruman:] (V.O.)
The world is changing. [View changesto the tower of Barad-d r, with itshuge Orc armies on a bridge.] Who nowhas the strength to stand against thearmies of Isengard and Mordor? To standagainst the might of Sauron and Sarumanand the union of the two towers?
[Camera pans upwards along the heightof the tower of Barad-d r until theflaming Eye is in view.]
[Saruman:] (V.O.)
Together, my lord Sauron, we shall rulethis Middle-earth.
[The trees around Isengard are beingripped down, chopped up and used tofeed huge furnaces. The caverns of Isengardglow with the fires of industry, soundsof hammering fill the air and molteniron is poured into casts to forge weapons.]

[Saruman:] (V.O.)
The old world will burn in the firesof industry. The forests will fall.A new order will rise. We will drivethe machine of war with the sword andthe spear and the iron fists of theOrc. We have only to remove those whooppose us.
[Saruman stands in the midst of a gatheringof Dunlanders.]
[Saruman:]
The horsemen took your land. They droveyour people into the hills to scratcha living off rocks.
DUNLAND MAN
Murderers!

[Saruman:]
Take back the lands they stole fromyou! Burn every village!
CROWD
[Roars with approval] Argh!!

[They stomp off to destroy the villagesof Rohan as Saruman stands coldly stillamong the stampede. A Rohan villageis in pandemonium as people try to escapethe on-coming pillage.]
[Saruman:] (V.O.)
It will begin in Rohan. Too long havethese peasants stood against you. Butno more.
[A woman with her hand on a horse callsout to her children.]
MORWEN
othain!  othain! You take your sister.You ll go faster with just two.
FREDA
[As Morwen puts her onto the horse infront of her brother] Papa says  othainmust not ride Garulf, he is too bigfor him!
MORWEN
Listen to me. You must ride to Edorasand raise the alarm. Do you understandme?
OTHAIN
Yes, Ma!

FREDA
[starts to cry] I don t wanna leave!I don't wanna go, Mama!
MORWEN
Freda, I will find you there.

[A woman screams]

MORWEN
Quickly!

[The children ride off.]

MORWEN
[Looks after them] Go child!

[Dunlanders and Uruk-hai enter the village,burning everything in sights as theRohirrim scream and run in all directions.othain and Freda weep as they lookback from a distance.]
[Saruman:] (V.O.)
Rohan, my lord, is ready to fall.

[A group of horsemen ride to Edoras.omer is in the lead, carrying a gravelywounded Th odred.]
[ owyn runs hastily up the stairs tothe Golden Hall and enters a bedchamber.She runs to the bed.]
OWYN
Th odred!

[Th odred seems to hear her call butis unable to respond. He has a bloodygash on the side of his head.  omernods to  owyn in the direction of Th odred storso.  owyn draws back the covers andupon seeing Th odred s fatal wound,her lips tighten and eyes close. Shelooks up to catch  omer s eye.]
[ omer and  owyn are speaking to Theoden-kingwho sits motionless on his throne, wizened,and aged beyond his years.]
OWYN
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

OMER
He was ambushed by Orcs. If we don tdefend our country, Saruman will takeit by force.
GR MA
That is a lie! [Appears from the shadows.]Saruman the White has ever been ourfriend and ally.
[Theoden:]
[mumbles feebly] Gr ma  Gr ma  [Gr maleans down close to the King.]My son...?Gr ma...?
OMER
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing atwill. Orcs bearing the white hand ofSaruman. [He drops a helmet onto theground, which topples over to revealthe white hand of Saruman.]
GR MA
Why do you lay these troubles on analready troubled mind. Can you not see?Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent,your war-mongering.
OMER
War-mongering?

[ omer grabs Gr ma and pins him againsta pillar.]
OMER
How long is it since Saruman boughtyou? What was the promised price, Gr ma?When all the men are dead you will takeyour share of the treasure?
[Gr ma s eyes flicks to right, watchingowyn as she walks by.  owyn stops tostare back for a moment before departingform the hall.  omer jerks Gr ma againand clutches his hand around Gr ma sjaw.]
OMER
Too long have you watched my sister,too long have you haunted her steps.

[Gr ma's eyes look to the left and relaxas  omer is suddenly pulled off Gr maby his thugs.]
GR MA
You see much  omer, Son of  omund. Toomuch. [The thugs punch  omer n the stomach]You are banished forthwith from thekingdom of Rohan. Under pain of death!

OMER
[Being dragged away] Argh!!



[Uruk-hai and Orcs continue to marchacross the plains with their hobbitcaptives, with Aragorn, Legolas, andGimli hot on their pursuits.]
[Gimli:]
Keep breathing! That s the key! Breathe!Ho!
[Legolas:]
They ve run as if the very whips oftheir masters were behind them.
[They continue running over vast distances.The Uruk-hai and Orcs halt at nightfall,many panting with exertion.]
MORDOR ORC
We re not going no further till we vehad a breather!
UGL K
Get a fire going!

[As the Orcs and Uruk-hai take theirrest, Pippin crawls over towards Merry.]

[Pippin:]
Merry! Merry!

[Merry:]
[opens his eyes] I think... we mighthave made a mistake leaving the Shire,Pippin.
[A group of Orcs chops down the treesnearby for firewood. Low groans andrumbles start to emerge from the forest.]

[Pippin:]
What s making that noise?

[Merry:]
[looks towards the forest] It s thetrees.
[Pippin:]
What?

[Merry:]
Do you remember the Old Forest? On theborders of Buckland? Folk used to saythat there was something in the waterthat made the trees grow tall... andcome alive.
[Pippin:]
Alive?

[Merry:]
Trees that could whisper. Talk to eachother. Even move.
MA HUR
I'm starving. We ain't 'ad nothin' butmaggoty bread for three stinkin' days!

SNAGA
Yeah. Why can t we have some meat? [Hiseyes rest on the hobbits.] What aboutthem? They re fresh.
UGL K
They are not for eating!

GRISHN KH
What about their legs? They don't needthose. Ooh  They look tasty!
UGL K
[Shoves at the Orcs] Get back, scum!

[The other Orcs are getting restless.]

MORDOR ORC
Carve them up!

SNAGA
[Moves towards the hobbits with hisblade drawn] Just a mouth full.
UGL K
No!

[Pippin and Merry recoil in fright.Ugl k jumps on the Orc and cuts offhis head, which bounces off the hobbit'sshoulders.]
UGL K
Looks like meat s back on the menu,boys!!
[The Uruk-hai and Orcs cheer and startedtearing into the fresh meat, intestinesflying, taking their eyes off the hobbitsfor a while.]
[Merry:]
Pippin, let s go.

[Their hands still bound, the hobbitstry to crawl away. Suddenly a foot comesdown on Merry and Pippin is turned ontohis back.]
GRISHN KH
[Brandishing a blade in front of Pippin sface] Go on, call for help. Squeal!No one s gonna save you now!
[Suddenly, a spear pierces the Orc'sback. Mayhem ensues as Riders of Rohanburst out from their hiding places andambush the Orcs.]
[Merry:]
Pippin! [Gestures for them to make theirescape.]
[The hobbits try to escape from thepandemonium to the forest, dodging bodiesand stomping feet. Suddenly Pippin turnsonto his face and looks up to a pairof thrashing hooves bearing down onhim.]
[Pippin:]
ARGH!!!



[The Three Hunters are still chasingafter the Uruk-hai. It is dawn.]
[Legolas:]
[Pauses and looks up] A red sun rises.Blood has been spilled this night.

[Camera pans over the rock and plains,alternating between the band of Uruk-haiand the Three Hunters giving chase.The trackers hear the sound of horses.Aragorn and company hide behind someboulders. A large group of horse-menappears, galloping quickly with theirbanners flying. Aragorn comes out ofhiding as they pass, followed by Legolasand Gimli.]
[Aragorn:]
Riders of Rohan, what news from theMark?
[At a signal from  omer at the lead,the riders make a quick turn and headtowards them, surrounding them in ever-tighteningcircles. As they stop, they point theirlong spears menacingly at them.]
OMER
What business does an Elf, a man anda Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speakquickly!
[Gimli:]
Give me your name, Horsemaster, andI shall give you mine.
[ omer hands his staff to another rider,and gets off his horse. Aragorn putsa hand on Gimli s shoulder.]
OMER
I would cut off your head, Dwarf, ifit stood but a little higher from theground.
[Legolas, in a lightning fast move,points an arrow at  omer.]
[Legolas:]
You would die before your stroke fell!

[The riders all point their spears closerat the travellers. After a tense moment,Aragorn pushes down Legolas  arm.]

[Aragorn:]
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. Thisis Gimli, son of Gl in and Legolas ofthe Woodland realm. We are friends ofRohan and of Theoden, your king.
OMER
Theoden no longer recognizes friendfrom foe. [Takes off helmet] Not evenhis own kin.
[The spears are withdrawn.]

OMER
Saruman has poisoned the mind of theking and claimed lordship over theselands. My company are those loyal toRohan. And for that, we are banished.The White Wizard is cunning. He walkshere and there, they say, as an oldman, hooded and cloaked. And everywherehis spies slip past our nets.
[Aragorn:]
We are not spies. We track a party ofUruk-hai westward across the plain.They ve taken two of our friends captive.

OMER
The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughteredthem during the night.
[Gimli:]
But there were two hobbits. Did yousee two hobbits with them?
[Aragorn:]
They would be small   only childrento your eyes.
OMER
We left none alive. We piled the carcassesand burned them. [Points to a smokingpile in the distance.]
[Gimli:]
Dead?

OMER
[nods] I am sorry.

[Legolas puts a hand on Gimli s shoulderin grief.  omer turns and whistles.]

OMER
Hasufel! Arod! [Two horses move up.]May these horses bear you to betterfortune than their former masters. Farewell.

[ omer puts on his helmet and gets backon his horse]
OMER
Look for your friends. But do not trustto hope, it has forsaken these lands.[To the riders] We ride north!
[Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli look onas the Riders go off. They then ridetowards the burning carcasses. Gimlistarts to shift through the smolderingpile, and pulls out a charred belt anddagger sheath.]
[Gimli:]
It s one of their wee belts.

[Legolas:]
[with his head bowed and eyes closed]Hiro  th  ab 'wanath... (May they findpeace in death)
[Aragorn:]
[Kicks a helmet and yells] AAARRGGHH!!![He falls to his knees.]
[Gimli:]
We failed them.

[Aragorn looks to the side as some trackscatch his attention.]
[Aragorn:]
A hobbit lay here, and the other. [Flashback:Pippin yells as he looks up at a pairof thrashing hooves bearing down onhim. He rolls over, avoiding the hooves.]They crawled.
[[Aragorn:] STARTS TO FOLLOW THE TRACKS, WITH LEGOLAS AND GIMLI BEHIND HIM. FLASHBACK
Merry and Pippin crawl frantically awayfrom the battle.]
[Aragorn:]
Their hands were bound. [Flashback:Merry rubs his bonds furiously againstthe sharp edge of a weapon.] Their bondswere cut. [Aragorn holds up a brokenlength of thick rope.]
[Aragorn:]
They ran over here. They were followed.

[FLASHBACK
Their hands freed, the hobbits run awayfrom the battle scene, dodging undera horse and trying to stay out of harmsway. As they flee, Grishn kh grabs Pippinby his belt and clings on.]
[Merry:]
The belt!

[Pippin undoes his belt and Grishn khis left holding it.]
[Merry:]
Run!

[Aragorn:]
The tracks lead away from the battle...[They break into a run and then stop]into Fangorn Forest.
[The Three looks up into a dense anddark forest]
[Gimli:]
Fangorn. What madness drove them inthere?


[Scene moves from the trackers intothe nighttime chase of Merry and Pippin.The hobbits run into the Fangorn, seekingto lose the pursuing Orc. They collapseonto the ground, out of breath.]
[Pippin:]
Did we lose him? [Looks around] I thinkwe lost him.
[Suddenly, Grishn kh appears from behindthe trees, brandishing a blade.]
GRISHN KH
I m gonna rip out your filthy littleinnards! Come here!
[Merry and Pippin run and hide behinda tree.]
[Merry:]
Trees! Climb a tree!

[Pippin and Merry quickly scramble upa tree each.]
[Merry:]
[Looks around and then sighs in relief.]He's gone.
[Suddenly, Merry is pulled by his legsand falls to the ground. Grishn kh leansover him with his menacing blade. Merrytries to kick him off but to no avail.]

[Pippin:]
Merry!

[Pippin looks down in horror but ashe turns his head, he spots a pair ofgleaming yellow eyes blinking in thetree he s clinging to. The tree startsto move and groan.]
[Treebeard:]
Hooooo...

[Pippin:]
Argh!!

[Pippin loses his grip in fright andgrabs at the air futilely as he falls.The tree catches him before he hitsthe ground.]
GRISHN KH
Let s put a maggot-hole in your belly.[Suddenly he senses something behindhim and as he looks up, the tree stompsand squashes him onto the forest floor.]

[Pippin:]
Run, Merry!

[Merry tries to run away but is scoopedby the tree.]
[Treebeard:]
[Looks at the creatures in his hands]Little Orcs! Bur rum...
[Pippin:]
It s talking, Merry. The tree is talking!

[Treebeard:]
Tree?! I am no tree. I am an Ent. [Stompsslowly through the forest.]
[Merry:]
A treeherder! A shepherd of the forest.

[Pippin:]
Don t talk to it, Merry. Don t encourageit.
[Treebeard:]
Treebeard, some call me.

[Pippin:]
And whose side are you on?

[Treebeard:]
Side? I am on nobody s side becausenobody s on my side, little Orc. Nobodycares for the woods anymore.
[Merry:]
We re not Orcs. We re Hobbits!

[Treebeard:]
Hobbits? Never heard of a hobbit before.Sounds like Orc mischief to me! [Tightenshis hold on the hobbits and squeezesthem. Merry and Pippin whimpers in pain]They come with fire, they come withaxes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking,burning! Destroyers and usurpers, cursethem!
[Merry:]
No, you don t understand. We re Hobbits...Halflings! Shirefolk!
[Treebeard:]
Maybe you are and maybe you aren t.The White Wizard will know.
[Pippin:]
The White Wizard?

[Merry:]
Saruman.

[Treebeard drops them on the groundand the hobbits look up at the WhiteWizard.]


[Following Gollum, Frodo and Sam reachthe end of Emyn Muil and see that Mordoris now closer.]
[Gollum:]
See, see, we have led you out! Hurryhobbitses hurry. Very lucky we findyou.
[Gollum jumps on a rock. Frodo walkspast, Gollum shrinks as Sam draws near.]

[Gollum:]
Nice hobbit. [Leaps after Frodo, puttinga wide berth between him and Sam.]

[Sam s foot slipped into muck.]

[Sam:]
Whoa, it s a bog! He s led us into aswamp!
[Gollum:]
A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. Wewill take you on safe paths throughthe mist. Come, hobbits, come. We goquickly.
[Gollum looks back and gestures forthe hobbits to follow.]
[Gollum:]
I found it, I did. The way through themarshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don'tknow it. They go round for miles andmiles. Come quickly. Swift and quickas shadows we must be.
[The marsh lands stretch for miles andmiles as far as the eye can see. Thehobbits and Gollum appear as littlespecks. As the three pick their waygingerly though the marshes, they seefaces floating in the water, still,rotting and pale, and flickering flameson the swamps.]
[Sam:]
There are dead things! Dead faces inthe water!
[Gollum:]
All dead. All rotten. Elves and menand orcses. A great battle long ago.[Turns to face the hobbits.] The DeadMarshes. Yes, yes that is their name.This way. Don t follow the lights.

[Sam s foot slips again into the water.]

[Sam:]
Ohh!

[Gollum:]
Careful now, or hobbits go down to jointhe dead ones and light little candlesof their own.
[Frodo is drawn to one of the facesin Elven armour. He stares at it intently,until suddenly its eyes open and Frodofalls face-down into the water.]
[Sam:]
Frodo!

[Frodo is in the water and sees manyfaces of the dead, no longer still butscreaming and grasping, their rottenrobes and hair flowing about their gruesomefaces. Their hands are reaching forhim. Suddenly he is grabbed from behind.Frodo sputters and gasps for air asGollum pulls him out of the water.]

[Frodo:]
[Looks at Gollum in perplexed gratitudeand disbelief.] Gollum...
[Gollum:]
Don t follow the lights! [Crawls away]

[Sam:]
[Runs to Frodo s side.] Mr. Frodo! Areyou alright?
[Frodo lies panting, staring after Gollum]



[NIGHTFALL
Sam is asleep but Frodo is still awake.He is holding the Ring in the palm ofhis hand and stroking it, mesmerized.Suddenly he hears Gollum.]
[Gollum:]
Sooo bright. Sooo beautiful. [Frodoquickly puts the Ring back inside hisshirt. He looks up to see Gollum crouchingaway from him, stroking the centre ofhis palm] our preciousss...
[Frodo:]
What did you say?

[Gollum:]
Master should be resting. Master needsto keep up his strength.
[Frodo:]
[Moves over and crouches in front ofGollum] Who are you?
[Gollum:]
Mustn't ask us. Not its business. *Gollum,Gollum*
[Frodo:]
Gandalf told me you were one of theRiver Folk.
[Gollum:]
Cold be heart and hand and bone. Coldbe travelers far from home.
[Frodo:]
He said your life was a sad story.

[Gollum:]
They do not see what lies ahead, whensun has failed and moon is dead.
[Frodo:]
You were not so very different froma hobbit once, were you... Smeagol?

[Gollum:]
[Looks up slowly.] What did you callme?
[Frodo:]
That was your name once, wasn't it?A long time ago.
[Gollum:]
My name... My name... S... S...Smeagol
[Suddenly, the piercing cries of theNazg l are heard overhead]
[Gollum:]
Argh!!

[Sam:]
Black Riders!

[Gollum:]
Hide! Hide!

[Frodo:]
Argh!

[Suddenly Frodo feels the pain of theNazg l's sword piercing him and thecall of the Ring. Images of the Ringwraithscome to him in flashes.]
[Frodo:]
Argh!!

[Sam:]
C mon Frodo! C'mon!

[Frodo continues to clutch at the Ringon his chest, immobilized. Sam dragsFrodo across to hide beneath some bramblebushes. The Nazg l appears, tighteninghis hold on the reins. Camera then showshim riding a Fell Beast, swooping downacross the marsh lands. Chilling screamsof the Nazg l fill the air.]
[Gollum:]
Quick! They will see us! They will seeus!
[Sam:]
I thought they were dead!

[Gollum:]
Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No.

[A loud screech from the Nazg l flyinghigh above the marshes.]
[Gollum:]
[cowering] Wraiths! Wraiths on wings!They are calling for it. They are callingfor the preciousss.
[Frodo feels the call of the Ring andgropes for his necklace. Sam sees thisand grabs hold of Frodo s hand.]
[Sam:]
Mr. Frodo! It s alright. I m here.

[The Nazg l continues to circle overheadand then flies off towards Mordor.]

[Gollum:]
Hurry, hobbits. The Black Gate is veryclose.


[Scene returns to Fangorn forest. Gimlifingers a dark stain on a leaf and bringsit to his mouth.]
[Gimli:]
[Spits] Ptui! Orc blood.

[Aragorn:]
These are strange tracks.

[Gimli:]
The air is so close in here.

[Legolas:]
This forest is old. Very old. Full ofmemory... and anger.
[Groans reverberate through the forestand Gimli raises his axe.]
[Legolas:]
The trees are speaking to each other.

[Aragorn:]
[Whispers] Gimli!

[Gimli:]
Huh?

[Aragorn:]
[Gestures] Lower your axe.

[Gimli:]
[Lowering his axe slowly] Oh.

[Legolas:]
Aragorn, nad n  ennas! (Something isout there.)
[Aragorn:]
Man cenich? (What do you see?)

[Close-up of Legolas  eyes]

[Legolas:]
The White Wizard approaches.

[Aragorn:]
Do not let him speak. He will put aspell on us.
[Aragorn wraps his hand around the hiltof his sword, Gimli tightens his holdon his axes, and Legolas notches anarrow to his bow.]
[Aragorn:]
We must be quick.

[With a yell, the three swing roundto attack. Gimli s axe and Legolasarrow are deflected. Aragorn drops hissword as it becomes red hot in his grasp.They shield their eyes with their handsfrom the bright light emanating fromthe White Wizard.]
WHITE WIZARD
You are tracking the footsteps of twoyoung hobbits.
[Aragorn:]
Where are they?

WHITE WIZARD
They passed this way the day beforeyesterday. They met someone they didnot expect. Does that comfort you?

[Aragorn:]
Who are you? Show yourself!

[The bright light dims, revealing Gandalf,all dressed in white. The three areastounded. Legolas and Gimli bow.]

[Aragorn:]
It cannot be. You fell.

[Gandalf:]
"Through fire and water. [Flashback:Gandalf is battling the Balrog atopD rin s Tower.] From the lowest dungeonto the highest peak, I fought with theBalrog of Morgoth."
[Gandalf holds up Glamdring and a flashof lightning strikes it before he plungesthe sword into the Balrog. With a finalcry, the Balrog falls from the peakand lands, smoking, onto the icy mountainside.]

[Gandalf:]
"Until at last, I threw down my enemyand smote his ruin upon the mountainside."

[On top of the mountain, Gandalf crawlsa bit and then collapses.]
[Gandalf:]
"Darkness took me. And I strayed outof thought and time. [Camera zooms inGandalf s eye and enters an amorphousrealm of stars and galaxies, endingin a blinding white light] Stars wheeledoverhead and everyday was as long asa life-age of the earth. But it wasnot the end. I felt life in me again."

[Camera zooms out from Gandalf s eye,lying naked and very still. His hairhas turned white and wounds are completelyhealed. He suddenly shudders with adeep gasp and pants as life returnsto him]
[Gandalf:]
"I've been sent back until my task isdone."
[Aragorn:]
Gandalf!

[Gandalf:]
"Gandalf? Yes... That's what they usedto call me. Gandalf the Grey. That wasmy name." [He smiles]
[Gimli:]
Gandalf!

[Gandalf:]
[With a twinkle in his eye] "I am Gandalfthe White. [Aragorn grins] And I comeback to you now at the turn of the tide."

[They walk through the forest, withGandalf leading the way, now wearinga grey cloak over his white robes.]

[Gandalf:]
"One stage of your journey is over, anotherbegins. War has come to Rohan. We mustride to Edoras with all speed."
[Outside the forest, Gandalf whistlespiercingly. Soon an answering neighis heard and a white horse appears fromthe plain, answering the call.]
[Legolas:]
That is one of the Mearas, unless myeyes are cheated by some spell.
[The horse comes round to stop in frontof Gandalf.]
[Gandalf:]
"Shadowfax. [Gimli bows in the background.]He's the lord of all horses and he'sbeen my friend through many dangers."

[The Three Hunters and Gandalf rideacross the plains to Edoras.]


[Back at Fangorn, Treebeard is walkingthrough the forest with Merry and Pippinsitting on his shoulders.]
[Treebeard:]
My home lies deep in the forest nearthe roots of the mountain. I told GandalfI would keep you safe and safe is whereI ll keep you. The trees have grownwild and dangerous. Anger festers intheir hearts. They will harm you ifthey can. There are too few of us now.Too few of us Ents left to manage them.



[Frodo and Sam are climbing a high rockoverlooking Morannon.]
[Gollum:]
The Black Gate of Mordor.

[The enormous Black Gate comes intoview with Orcs patrolling and standingguard on the towers and atop the walls.From the right, an army of Easterlingsoldiers is marching to the Black Gate.]

[Sam:]
Oh save us. My ol' Gaffer'd have a thingor two to say if he could see us now.

[Gollum:]
Master says to show him the way intoMordor, so good Smeagol does. Mastersays so.
[Frodo:]
I did.

[Orcs are patrolling the Black Gate.]

[Sam:]
That s it then. We cannot get past that.

[A command is heard and an Orc soundsa horn, signalling for the Gate to beopened. Two enormous cave trolls stretchand growl and then pull the mighty Gateopen.]
[Sam:]
Look! The gate, it's opening! I cansee a way down.
[He moves closer to the edge. Suddenly,the rock underneath him gives way andhe falls.]
[Frodo:]
Sam, no!

[Sam:]
Argh!!

[Frodo goes after Sam.]

[Gollum:]
Master!

[Two Easterling soldiers see streamsof dust coming down the cliff made bySam and Frodo. They move away from thetroop to investigate. Frodo reachesSam who is stuck in the scree. As theEasterlings move closer and closer,Frodo throws his Elvish cloak over himselfand Sam. The soldiers are now directlyin front of Sam, but their eyes seenothing but rock. Frodo and Sam peerfrom underneath the cloak. The soldierssoon leave and after a moment, Frodothrows back the cloak and pulls Samout.]
[Frodo:]
I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.

[Sam:]
I know, Mr.Frodo. I doubt even theseElvish cloaks will hide us in there.

[They prepare to make a run for theGate.]
[Frodo:]
Now!

[Gollum pulls them back.]

[Gollum:]
No! No, no master! They catch you! Theycatch you! Don t take it to him! Hewants the preciousss. Always he s lookingfor it! And the preciousss is wantingto go back to him. But we mustn't lethim have it.
[Frodo tries to make a run for it.]

[Gollum:]
No! [Pulls Frodo back again.] There sanother way. More secret. A dark way.

[Sam:]
Why haven t you spoken of this before?!

[Gollum:]
Because Master did not ask!

[Sam:]
He s up to something.

[Frodo:]
Are you saying there s another way intoMordor?
[Gollum:]
Yes. There is a path, and some stairs,and then  a tunnel.
[Frodo and Sam watch as the Black Gatecloses. Gollum is stroking Frodo s armand burying his face in his cloak.]

[Frodo:]
He s led us this far, Sam.

[Sam:]
Mr. Frodo, no.

[Frodo:]
He s been true to his word.

[Sam:]
[Whispers] No!

[Frodo:]
Lead the way, Smeagol.

[Gollum:]
Good Smeagol always helps.

[Frodo follows Gollum as Sam staresafter him in disbelief.]
[On the plains of Rohan. Gandalf, Aragorn,Legolas and Gimli stop as Edoras comesinto view.]
[Gandalf:]
"Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan,whose mind is overthrown. Saruman'shold over King Theoden is now very strong."

[In the Hall,  owyn is kneeling beforeTheoden, holding his hand in hers.]

OWYN
My lord, your son, he is dead. My lord?Uncle?
[Theoden just sits and stares ahead,his eyes clouded and unseeing.]
OWYN
Will you not go to him? [She weeps.]Will you do nothing?
[Scene returns to Gandalf and company.]

[Gandalf:]
"Be careful what you say. Do not lookfor welcome here."
[They ride on towards Edoras.]



[At Edoras,  owyn is weeping at thedead Th odred's bed. She kisses hishand. Gr ma appears at the door.]

GR MA
Oh, he  he must have died sometime inthe night. What a tragedy for the kingto lose his only son and heir.
[He sits on the bed and puts a handon  owyn s shoulder.]
GR MA
I understand his passing is hard toaccept, especially now that your brotherhas deserted you.
OWYN
[jumps back and throws off Gr ma s hand]Leave me alone, snake!
GR MA
[Rises from the bed and moves ever closerto  owyn] Oh, but you are alone! Whoknows what you have spoken to the darkness.In bitter watches of the night, whenall your life seems to shrink, the wallsof your bower closing in about you,like a hutch to trammel some wild thingin.
[He puts a hand on her cheek and movesdown to her throat.]
GR MA
So fair, so cold, like a morning ofpale spring still clinging to winter'schill.
[ owyn and Gr ma stare at each otherintently.]
OWYN
Your words are poison!

[ owyn runs out of the hall. Weeping,she looks away into the distance. Aflag comes off its pole and is carriedby the breeze.  owyn sees riders comingtowards Edoras. As Aragorn passes theentrance to Edoras, the flag floatsdown to land near him. Edoras is silentand somber. Everyone is dressed in blackand staring at the newcomers in warysilence. Aragorn looks up at the halland sees a lady in white standing onthe steps. He looks around at more somberpeople.]
[Gimli:]
You ll find more cheer in a graveyard.

[Aragorn looks up to the hall againbut the lady has disappeared. The companyclimbs up the stairs to the hall andis met by guards.]
[Gandalf:]
[sees H ma] "Ah."

H MA
I cannot allow you before Theoden-Kingso armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By orderof Gr ma Wormtongue.
[Gandalf nods in understanding and signalsfor the others to surrender their weapons.Aragon hands over his sword and knives.Legolas gives a little twirl to hisknives before handing them over to theguards. Gimli hands over his axes reluctantly.]

H MA
[gestures to Gandalf] Your staff.

[Gandalf:]
"Hmm? [Glances at his staff.] Oh. Youwould not part an old man from his walkingstick?" [Looks at H ma innocently.]

[H ma hesitates for a second and thengestures that they follow him into thehall. Gandalf gives Aragorn a tiny winkand enters the hall, leaning on Legolasarm.]
GR MA
[Leaning down and whispering to Theoden.]My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.He s a herald of woe.
[Gandalf:]
"The courtesy of your hall is somewhatlessened of late, Theoden King."
[As Gandalf approaches Theoden, Aragorn,Legolas and Gimli pull back and surveythe hall and its hostile occupants.A group of men starts to follow theirsteps with hostility.]
GR MA
[Whispering to Theoden.] He s not welcome.

[Theoden:]
Why should I  welcome you, GandalfStormcrow? [Looks to Gr ma for affirmation.]

GR MA
A just question, my liege. [He walkstowards Gandalf.] Late is the hour inwhich this conjurer chooses to appear.Lathspell spell I name him. Ill newsis an ill guest.
[Gandalf:]
"Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behindyou teeth. I have not passed throughfire and death to bandy crooked wordswith a witless worm!" [Raises his staffagainst Gr ma.]
GR MA
His staff! [Backing away from Gandalfwhile addressing the guards] I toldyou to take the wizard s staff!
[The hostile guards attack. Aragorn,Legolas and Gimli engage them in a fist-fightas Gandalf continues to approach Theoden.Gamling tries to go forward but H maholds him back.]
[Gandalf:]
"Theoden, son of Thengel, too long haveyou sat in the shadows."
[Gr ma tries to crawl away unnoticed,but Gimli catches him and pins him tothe floor.]
[Gimli:]
[Growls] I would stay still, if I wereyou.
[Gandalf:]
"Hearken to me! I release you from thespell." [Gestures with his hand]
[Theoden:]
[Menacingly] Hahahhhahahahah! [Gandalfopens his eyes in surprise.] You haveno power here, Gandalf the Grey!
[Gandalf throws back his grey cloak,exuding blinding white light. Theodenis thrown back against his seat.]

[Theoden:]
Argh!

[Gandalf:]
[Points his staff towards Theoden.]"I will draw you, Saruman, as poisonis drawn from a wound."
[ owyn rushes in. Seeing her uncle threatened,she tries to go to him but is held backby Aragorn.]
[Aragorn:]
Wait.

[Theoden:]
[In Saruman s voice.] If I go. . . Theodendies.
[Gandalf moves his staff sharply andTheoden flies back against the chairagain.]
[Gandalf:]
"You did not kill me, you will not killhim!"
[Theoden:]
[in Saruman's voice] Rohan is mine!

[Gandalf:]
"Be gone!!"

[Gandalf smites Theoden as he lungesat him. Theoden is thrown back intothe chair and the shot changes to Sarumanflying backwards from the Palantir whichhe used to manipulate Theoden. He landslanding hard on the floor of Orthanc,bleeding from a gash in his forehead.In the hall, Theoden lets out a moanand slumps forward in the chair.  owynruns to her uncle s side as he falls.Theoden s head rises again and his facebegins to change gradually into thatof a much younger-looking man. Clarityand recognition returns to his eyes.]

[Theoden:]
[Looks closely at  owyn] I know yourface.  owyn   owyn.
[ owyn weeps with joy]

[Theoden:]
Gandalf?

[Gandalf:]
"Breathe the free air again, my friend."

[The hall is shown to be filled withlight again, as everyone marvels atthe rejuvenation of the king.]
[Theoden:]
[Standing up and looking around him.]Dark have been my dreams of late. [Helooks down at his trembling hands.]

[Gandalf:]
"Your fingers would remember their oldstrength better... if they grasped yoursword."
[H ma runs up with his sword. Theodenreaches for it with trembling hands.He wraps his fingers around it slowlyand then draws it, gazing upon the shinysteel. In a corner, Gr ma trembles andtries to escape but is pulled back byGimli. Suddenly, Theoden s gaze turnsto Gr ma. Gr ma is thrown out of thehall and down the stairs.]
GR MA
Argh! [Beseechingly to Theoden] I'veonly ever served you, my lord!
[Theoden:]
[Advancing towards Gr ma, holding thesword firmly in his hand] Your leechcraftwould have had me crawling on all fourslike a beast!
GR MA
[Grovelling] Send me not from your side.

[Theoden raises his sword to kill Gr ma.Aragorn holds him back.]
[Aragorn:]
No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go.Enough blood has been spilled on hisaccount.
[Gr ma scrambles to his feet and pushesthrough the crowd]
GR MA
Get out of my way!

H MA
Hail, Theoden king!

[The crowd kneels in homage before Theoden.Aragorn kneels also. Gr ma rides outof Edoras. As Theoden turns to go backinto the hall, he looks up.]
[Theoden:]
Where is Th odred? Where is my son?



[A white flower comes into view, heldup by a hand. It is released and spiralsdown to land among similar flowers,in front of a tomb.]
[Theoden:]
Simbelmyn . Ever has it grown on thetombs of my forebearers. [Looks at Gandalf]Now it shall cover the grave of my son.Alas, that these evil days should bemine. The young perish and the old linger.That I should live to see the last daysof my house.
[Gandalf:]
"Theodred's death was not of your making."

[Theoden:]
No parent should have to bury theirchild.
[Theoden starts to weep]

[Gandalf:]
"He was strong in life. His spirit willfind its way to the halls of your fathers.Westu hal. Ferou, Theodred, Ferou. (Be-thouwell. Go-thou, Theodred, go-thou.)"

[Gandalf turns to go back to the halland leaves Theoden to grieve in private.He spots two children on horseback.The boy collapses and falls off thehorse. Later, inside the Golden Hall,the two children are eating at a table,and  owyn is with them.]
OWYN
They had no warning. They were unarmed.Now the wildmen are moving through theWestfold, burning as they go. Rick,cot and tree.
FREDA
Where s mama?

OWYN
Shh...

[Gandalf:]
"This is but a taste of the terror thatSaruman will unleash. All the more potentfor he is driven now by fear of Sauron.Ride out and meet him head on. Drawhim away from your women and children.[Leans forward and puts a hand on Theoden'schair. Theoden looks at his hand warily.]You must fight."
[Aragorn:]
You have two thousand good men ridingnorth as we speak.  omer is loyal toyou. His men will return and fight fortheir king.
[Theoden:]
They will be three hundred leagues fromhere by now.  omer cannot help us. Iknow what it is that you want of me.But I will not bring further death tomy people. I will not risk open war.

[Gimli takes a bite of his bread ashe watches the exchange between Aragornand Theoden.]
[Aragorn:]
Open war is upon you. Whether you wouldrisk it or not.
[Theoden:]
When last I looked, Theoden, not Aragorn,was king of Rohan.
[Gimli takes a drink and burps.]

[Gandalf:]
"Then what is the king's decision?"

[Scene shifts to outside Meduseld]

H MA
By order of the king, the city mustempty. We make for the refuge of Helm sDeep. Do not burden yourselves withtreasures. Take only what provisionsyou need.
[People are moving about, gatheringtheir belongings and preparing to move.Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimliwalk towards the stables.]
[Gimli:]
Helm s Deep! They flee to the mountainswhen they should stand and fight. Whowill defend them if not their king.

[Aragorn:]
He s only doing what he thinks is bestfor his people. Helm s Deep has savedthem in the past.
[They enter the stables]

[Gandalf:]
"There is no way out of that ravine.Theoden is walking into a trap. He thinkshe s leading them to safety. What theywill get is a massacre. Theoden hasa strong will but I fear for him. Ifear for the survival of Rohan. He willneed you before the end, Aragorn. Thepeople of Rohan will need you. The defensesHAVE to hold."
[Aragorn:]
They will hold.

[Gandalf:]
[Turns to Shadowfax and strokes him]"The Grey Pilgrim... that's what theyused to call me. Three hundred livesof men I've walked this earth and nowI have no time. With luck, my searchwill not be in vain. Look to my comingat first light on the fifth day. Atdawn, look to the East."
[Aragorn:]
[Opens the stall gates] Go.

[Legolas jumps back as Gandalf ridesout of the stable and over the plainsof Rohan.]


[ owyn opens a chest in which lies asword. She unsheathes it and beginsto practice. She swings around and ismet by Aragorn, who blocks her parry.]

[Aragorn:]
You have some skill with a blade.

[With a swift move,  owyn swings hersword and renders Aragorn vulnerable,gaining the upper hand.]
OWYN
[Stepping back and sheathing her sword.]Women of this country learned long ago:Those without swords may still die uponthem. I fear neither death nor pain.

[Aragorn:]
What do you fear, my lady?

OWYN
A cage. To stay behind bars until useand old age accept them and all chanceof valor has gone beyond recall or desire.

[Aragorn:]
You are a daughter of kings, a shieldmaidenof Rohan. [He sheaths his knife.] Ido not think that would be your fate.

[He bows and  owyn gazes after him ashe walks away.]


[The people of Rohan are moving outof Edoras towards Helm s Deep, withTheoden leading the way. At Isengard,Gr ma confers with Saruman, holdinga cloth to his mouth.]
GR MA
Theoden will not stay at Edoras. It svulnerable, he knows this. He will expectan attack on the city. They will fleeto Helm s Deep, the great fortress ofRohan. It is a dangerous road to takethrough the mountains. They will beslow. They will have women and childrenwith them.
[Saruman s eyebrows rise in response.He walks through the depths of Isengardand gives orders to an Orc.]
[Saruman:]
Send out your warg riders.

[The Orc smiles. In a pit behind him,ferocious growls are heard and shadowsdances.]


[Gollum is trying to catch a fish inthe river. He slips and falls, graspingat a slippery fish as he goes. Frodoand Sam follow behind.]
[Sam:]
Hey Stinker! Don t go getting too farahead!
[Frodo:]
Why do you do that?

[Sam:]
What?

[Frodo:]
Call him names; run him down all thetime.
[Sam:]
Because  because that's what he is,Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in 'imbut lies and deceit. It's the Ring hewants. It's all he cares about.
[Frodo:]
[Glaring at Sam] You have no idea whatit did to him. What it s still doingto him. [He walks past Sam and stops.]I want to help him, Sam...
[Sam:]
Why?

[Frodo:]
Because I have to believe he can comeback.
[Sam:]
You can t save him, Mr. Frodo.

[Frodo:]
[Snapping at Sam]What do you know aboutit? Nothing!
[Sam walks away slowly.]

[Frodo:]
[With remorse] I'm sorry, Sam. I don'tknow why I said that.
[Sam:]
[Looks back at Frodo with tears in hiseyes.] I do. It's the Ring. You can'ttake your eyes off it. I've seen you.You're not eating. You barely sleep.It's taken a hold of you, Mr.Frodo.You have to fight it!
[Frodo:]
[Grows angry again] I know what I haveto do Sam. The Ring was entrusted tome! It's my task! Mine! My own! [Hewalks away]
[Sam:]
Can t you hear yourself? Don t you knowwho you sound like?
[Frodo continues to walk away withoutlooking back.]


[Nighttime, Frodo and Sam are asleep.Gollum is crouching in a corner by himself.]

[Gollum:]
We wants it. We needs it. Must havethe precioussss. They stole it fromus. Sneaky little hobbitsesss. Wicked,trickssssy, falssse!
[Smeagol:]
No! Not Master.

[Gollum:]
Yes, precious. False. They will cheatyou, hurt you, lie.
[Smeagol:]
Master s my friend.

[Gollum:]
[Tauntingly] You don t have any friends.Nobody likes YOU...
[Smeagol:]
[Covers his ears] Not listening. I mnot listening.
[Gollum:]
You re a liar and a thief.

[Smeagol:]
[Shaking his head] Nope.

[Gollum:]
Mur derer !

[Smeagol:]
[Starts to weep and whimper] Go away.

[Gollum:]
Go away! [Cackles] HAHAHAHA!!

[Smeagol:]
[Weeping and in a small voice] I hateyou. I hate you!
[Gollum:]
[Fiercely] Where would you be withoutme? *Gollum, gollum*. I saved us. Itwas me. We survived because of me!

[Smeagol:]
[Resolute] Not anymore.

[Gollum:]
[Startled] What did you say?

[Smeagol:]
Master looks after us now. We don tneed you.
[Gollum:]
What?

[Smeagol:]
Leave now and never come back.

[Gollum:]
No!!

[Smeagol:]
[Louder] Leave now and never come back!

[Gollum:]
[Growls and bares his teeth] Arrrgh!!!

[Smeagol:]
LEAVE. NOW. AND. NEVER. COME. BACK!

[Smeagol pants and then looks around.]

[Smeagol:]
We... we told him to go away! And awayhe goes, preciousss. [He hops aroundin joy and does a little dance.] Gone,gone, gone! Smeagol is free!
[The next day, while the hobbits wereresting, Smeagol comes back with tworabbits and drops them onto Frodo slap.]
[Smeagol:]
Look! Look! See what Smeagol finds!Hehehe! Hahaha!
[Frodo looks at up him with bloodshoteyes. He smiles at Smeagol and looksat Sam. Smeagol raises a fist in self-congratulationand dances around. He then picks upone of the rabbits and snaps the rabbit'sback in front of Frodo.]
[Smeagol:]
They are young. They are tender. Theyare nice. Yes they are! Eat them! Eatthem!
[He bites and tears into the raw meat.Sam rushes over and snatches the rabbitout of Gollum s hands]
[Sam:]
You ll make him sick, you will, behavinglike that! [Holding up the two rabbits]There s only one way to eat a braceof coneys.
[A pot of stew is simmering over a fire.]

[Smeagol:]
[Looking into the pot] Argh!! What sit doing! Stupid fat hobbit! It ruinsit!
[Sam:]
What s to ruin? There s hardly any meaton  em.
[A faint calling sound catches the attentionof Frodo.]
[Sam:]
What we need is a few good taters.

[Gollum:]
What s taters, preciousss? What s tatersuh?
[Sam:]
PO-TAY-TOES! Boil  em. Mash  em. Stickem in a stew. Lovely big golden chipswith a nice piece of fried fish....

[Smeagol:]
[Sticks out his tongue in disgust] Pbbbttt!!

[Sam:]
Even you couldn t say no to that. [Hetakes a sip of the stew]
[Smeagol:]
Oh yes we could! Spoil nice fish...[scrambles up close to Sam] Give itto usss rrraw... and wrrriggling! [Makessickeningly happy face.] You keep nastychips. [Hops away]
[Sam:]
You re hopeless.

[Frodo follows the source of the sound.Sam suddenly notices that Frodo is nolonger in his sight.]
[Sam:]
Mr. Frodo?

[He goes in search of Frodo and findshim lying down near some bushes lookingat a Haradrim army marching across theland. He moves to lie low beside Frodo.Smeagol also moves in beside Frodo.]

[Sam:]
Who are they?

[Gollum:]
Wicked men. Servants of Sauron. Theyare called to Mordor. The Dark One isgathering all armies to him. It won tbe long now. He will soon be ready.

[Sam:]
Ready to do what?

[Gollum:]
To make his war. The last war that willcover all the world in shadow.
[Frodo:]
We ve got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

[Sam:]
[Suddenly grabs Frodo s arm] Mr.Frodo!Look! It s an Oliphaunt!
[Gigantic Oliphaunts appear, carryingsoldiers and supplies on their backs.]

[Sam:]
No one at home will believe this...

[Smeagol slips away unnoticed.]

[Frodo:]
[Looking around] Smeagol?

[Suddenly, pandemonium breaks out frombelow; the soldiers are being ambushed.Cloaked rangers are firing deadly arrowsat the soldiers and Oliphaunts frombehind bushes. One of the Oliphauntsstarts trumpeting and stomping towardsFrodo and Sam, swinging his huge trunkand tusks. Faramir takes aim and shootsa soldier. He falls from the Oliphauntand lands right behind Frodo and Sam,dead.]
[Frodo:]
We ve lingered here too long. Come on,Sam!
[Frodo runs right into a Gondorian Ranger,who grabs hold of him and throws himonto his back. Sam sees Frodo in dangerand grapples for his sword]
[Sam:]
Ah!

[He charges at Faramir but is grabbedby another ranger and thrown down. Asword appears at his throat. Faramirappears.]
FARAMIR
Bind their hands.



[Meanwhile, the Rohirrim refugees areheading towards Helm s Deep. Gimli ison a horse, chatting with  owyn whois leading it by the reins.]
[Gimli:]
It s true you don t see many Dwarf women.And in fact, they are so alike in voiceand appearance, haha that they re oftenmistaken for Dwarf men.
[ owyn smiles and looks back at Aragorn.]

[Aragorn:]
[Gestures and whispers] It s the beards....

[Gimli:]
And this, in turn, has given rise tothe belief that there are no Dwarf women.And that dwarves just spring out ofholes in the ground!
OWYN
[Laughs gaily] Hahahaha!!

[Gimli:]
Hehehe! Which is of course ridiculousWhoa!!
[The horse suddenly rears up and gallopsaway as  owyn loses her hold on thereins. Gimli falls off after a shortdistance and lands with a loud thump.]

OWYN
Ooh! [She rushes forward to Gimli]

[Gimli:]
[Struggling to get up] It s alright,it s alright. Nobody panic. That wasdeliberate. It was deliberate.
[ owyn helps Gimli up. She laughs asshe brushes him off and looks back atAragorn with the sun behind her andthe wind in her hair. At that particularmoment, Aragorn seems enchanted by  owyn slight-hearted image. That night. Aragorncould not sleep and smokes his pipeas he thinks of Arwen.]
[Arwen:] (V.O.)
The light of the Evenstar does not waxand wane  It is mine to give to whomI will... Like my heart  Go to sleep...

[FLASHBACK
Aragorn is lying on a chaise in Rivendell.He opens his eyes and sees Arwen beforehim, smiling down at him.]
[Aragorn:]
I am asleep. This is a dream.

[Arwen:]
[Bends down to kiss him] Then it isa good dream. Sleep[She kisses him lightly on the lipsand then steps away to look out uponRivendell. Aragorn closes his eyes butfor a while. He looks over at Arwen.]

[Aragorn:]
Min l  pennich nin i aur hen telitha.(You told me once that this day wouldcome.)
[Arwen:]
[Turns to look at Aragorn]   i vethed...n  i onnad. Boe bedich go Frodo. Hanb d l n. (This is not the end... itis the beginning. You must go with Frodo.That is your path.)
[Aragorn:]
[Walks over to Arwen] Dolen i v d onin. (My path is hidden from me.)

[Arwen:]
Si peliannen i v d na dail l n. Si boe-dhannathach. (It is already laid beforeyour feet. You cannot falter now.)

[Aragorn:]
Arwen
[Arwen hushes him, resting her fingerson his lips. As her hands moves downto rest on the Evenstar pendant aroundAragorn s neck, he clasps her hand inhis and they gaze into each other seyes.]
[Arwen:]
Ae  -esteliach nad... estelio han. Estelioammen. (If you trust nothing else...trust this. Trust us.)
[They kiss.]



[The next day, on the journey to Helm sDeep.  owyn is walking alongside Aragorn.]

OWYN
Where is she? The woman who gave youthat jewel.
[[Aragorn:] SMILES AND SAYS NOTHING. FLASHBACK
Elrond is speaking to Aragorn in Rivendell,before he sets out with the Fellowship.]

[Elrond:]
Our time here is ending. Arwen s timeis ending. Let her go. Let her takethe ship into the west. Let her bearaway her love for you to the UndyingLands. There it will be evergreen.

[Aragorn:]
But never more than a memory.

[Elrond:]
I will not leave my daughter here todie.
[Aragorn:]
She stays because she still has hope.

[Elrond:]
She stays for YOU! She belongs withher people!
[Aragorn and Arwen are together beforethe Fellowship departs.]
[Aragorn:]
Idhren emmen menna gui ethwel. Hae oauth a n r a naeth. (You have a chancefor another life. Away from war... grief...despair.)
[Arwen:]
Why are you saying this?

[Aragorn:]
I am mortal; you are Elfkind. It wasa dream, Arwen, nothing more.
[He takes Arwen s hand to return theEvenstar necklace to her.]
[Aragorn:]
This belongs to you.

[Arwen:]
[Closes Aragorn s hand over the Evenstar]It was a gift. Keep it.
[Scene shifts back to Aragorn and  owyn]

OWYN
My lord?

[Aragorn:]
She is sailing to the Undying Lands,with all that is left of her kin.

[Gamling and Ham  ride to the front.Legolas watches them as they pass.]

GAMLING
What is it? H ma?

[Their horses become restless.]

H MA
[Looking around] I m not sure.

[A warg scout appears on a slope aboveand charges at them. The warg attacksH ma and kills him.]
GAMLING
Wargs!

[Just as it starts to turn on Gamling,Legolas runs over and kills the wargwith an arrow. He then draws his knifeand kills the Orc.]
[Legolas:]
Argh! [Shouts to Aragorn] A scout!

[Theoden:]
What is it? What do you see?

[Aragorn:]
[Running back to Theoden] Wargs! Weare under attack!
[Hearing the alarm, the villagers beginto cry and panic.]
[Aragorn:]
Get them out of here!

[Theoden:]
All riders to the head of the column!

[Gimli:]
[Trying to mount Arod] Come on, getme up here, I m a rider! Argh!
[Gimli gets onto the horse with somehelp. Legolas gazes into the distanceand sees many warg-riders coming fasttowards them, kicking up dust trailsas they go.]
[Theoden:]
[To  owyn] You must lead the peopleto Helm s Deep. And make haste!
OWYN
I can fight!

[Theoden:]
No! You must do this... for me.

[ owyn holds Theoden s gaze for a momentand then turn to attend to the villagers.]

[Theoden:]
[To his men] Follow me! Yah!

[Gimli:]
[Tries to get Arod to move] Forward.I mean, charge forward! March forward![Arod moves off with Gimli seated ratherunsteadily.] That s it! Go on!
OWYN
[To the villagers] Make for the lowerground! Stick together!
[She looks back at the Rohirrim andsees Aragorn on Hasufel. They hold eachother s gaze for a moment before Aragornturns to join Theoden.  owyn departswith the villagers in the opposite direction.]

[Legolas takes aim at the distant targetand fells a warg rider. He draws anotherarrow and kills another. Just as hereaches for a third arrow, he sees Theodenand company approaching. He quicklyruns and mounts Arod with a smooth leapand joins in the fray with Gimli behindhim on horseback.]
WARG-RIDERS
Argh!!

[Theoden:]
CHARGE!!

[The Rohirrim and warg riders crashhead on and the battle begins. Theodenand company hack away at the warg riders.In the midst of fighting, Gimli fallsoff Arod. He turns to find a warg growlingat him.]
[Gimli:]
Bring your pretty face to my axe!

[Just as the warg leaps at Gimli, Legolaskills it with one shot.]
[Gimli:]
[Jumping back as the warg falls, outraged]Argh! That one counts as mine!
[As Gimli swings his axe at anotherwarg, it dies and falls onto Gimli,pinning him under.]
[Gimli:]
Argh! Stinking creature. Argh!

[As he tries to lift the warg off him,an Orc leans over them both. Gimli killshim quickly, twisting his neck, andit lands on him also. Gimli sniffs atthe Orc and makes a face. He tries tolift both the warg and Orc off him.Just then, another warg comes upon himand bares its teeth, ready to strike.]
[Gimli:]
[Eyes widening] Ooh..!

[Aragorn plucks a spear as he passeson horseback and throws it at the warg.It dies, landing on Gimli and addingto the pile on top of him.]
[Gimli:]
[As the warg lands on him] Oooh!!

[Theoden stabs at a warg rider. Aragornis knocked off Hasufel and attackedby Sharku. Aragorn tries to kill thewarg rider but Sharku blocks his attemptand grabs Aragorn by the neck, whilethe latter is half-dragged by the warg.In the struggle, Sharku is thrown offand he rips the Evenstar pendant fromAragorn s neck as he falls. Aragorntries to let go of the warg but findshis wrist tangled with the saddle straps.He tries unsuccessfully to disentanglehimself and is dragged closer and closerto the edge of a cliff at great speed.The warg runs right off the cliff andthey both disappear over the edge. Thebattle is winding down as the Rohirrimfinish off the last few wargs and Orcs.]

[Legolas:]
[Looking around] Aragorn!

[Gimli:]
Aragorn?

[They come near to the cliff and hearSharku wheezing and laughing]
[Gimli:]
[Standing over the dying Orc] Tell mewhat happened and I will ease your passing.

SHARKU
He s [cough] dead. [Laughs evilly] Tooka little tumble off the cliff.
[Legolas:]
[Looks towards the edge of the cliff,and grabs Sharku] You lie!
[Sharku chortles and dies. Legolas looksdown at Sharku s fist and finds theEvenstar pendant. He takes it, runsto the edge of the cliff and looks downto see the great drop and rushing watersbelow, with no sign of Aragorn. Gimlicomes to stand beside him.]
[Theoden:]
[To his men] Get the wounded on horses.The wolves of Isengard will return.Leave the dead.
[Legolas turns to Theoden, an expressionof perplexed anger on his face.]
[Theoden:]
[Puts a hand on Legolas' shoulder] Come.

[He leaves Legolas and Gimli to staredown at the river.]


[The Rohan villagers are drawing closeto Helm s Deep. Cries of relief areheard as the refuge is within sight.]

REFUGEES
Helm s Deep! At last! There it is!

OLD WOMAN
[To  owyn] We re safe, my lady! Thankyou!
[ owyn embraces the woman and they walkon towards Helm s Deep. The gate isopened for the villagers. Many havealready taken refuge within and areresting along the passage.  othain andFreda run towards their mother.]
FREDA
Mama!

MORWEN
othain! Freda!

[The three hug and cry with joy. Theodenand company returns from the battlewith warg riders]
GAMLING
Make way for Theoden!

SOLDIERS
Sire!

GAMLING
Make way for the king!

[ owyn rushes down to meet them]

OWYN
[Looking about] So few. So few of youhave returned.
[Theoden:]
[Dismounting] Our people are safe. Wehave paid for it with many lives.

[Gimli:]
[Going up to  owyn] My lady...

OWYN
Lord Aragorn, where is he?

[Gimli:]
He fell...

[ owyn is shaken and raises teary eyesto Theoden. The latter looks down andthen walks away, confirming her unaskedquestion.]


[At the battlements]

[Theoden:]
Draw all our forces behind the wall.Bar the gate, and set a watch on thesurround.
GAMLING
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?The women and children?
[Theoden:]
Get them into the caves. [Walks downthe steps and past a sewer gate] Saruman'sarm would have grown long indeed ifhe thinks he can reach us here.
[Camera zooms in on the gate]

GR MA (V.O.)
Helm s Deep has one weakness. Its outerwall is solid rock but for a small culvertat its base which is little more thana drain.
[Camera turns to Gr ma and Saruman atOrthanc. Saruman is pouring some darkdry substances into a vessel. Gr mais holding a lit candle in his hand.]

GR MA
How? How can fire undo stone? What kindof device could bring down the wall?

[As he steps closer to the vessel, Sarumantakes hold of Gr ma s hand and pushesthe candle away from the vessel firmly.]

[Saruman:]
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deepwill fall.
[He walks away towards the balcony.]

GR MA
[Following Saruman] Even if it is breached,it would take a number beyond reckoning,thousands to storm the keep.
[Saruman:]
Tens of thousands.

GR MA
But, my lord, there is no such force.

[Both of them came onto the balconyof the tower. Gr ma suddenly sees andhears the enormous armies laid out belowin neat rows and is astounded and awed.He continues to hold the extinguishedcandle aloft as he gapes at the vastarmy below. A horn is sounded, announcingthe appearance of Saruman. A loud cheeris heard from the army. Saruman raisesa hand.]
[Saruman:]
A new power is rising. Its victory isat hand!
[The army cheers and roars.]

[Saruman:]
This night, the land will be stainedwith the blood of Rohan! March to HelmsDeep! Leave none alive!
[The camera keeps zooming out from thebalcony over the incredible size ofSaruman s army, past Uruk-hai, spears,and banners and yet more Uruk-hai. Thecamera focuses back on Saruman who thenraises his hands in the air]
[Saruman:]
To war!!

[The army cheers and roars even louder.]

[Saruman:]
[Sneers] There will be no dawn for Men.

[A tear flows down Gr ma s cheek. TheUruk-hai army began their march to Helm sDeep.]


[Merry and Pippin are travelling throughthe forest, carried by Treebeard.]

[Pippin:]
Look! There s smoke to the south!

[Treebeard:]
There is always smoke rising from Isengardthese days.
[Merry:]
Isengard?

[The two hobbits climb higher up ontoTreebeard for a better view.]
[Treebeard:]
There was a time when Saruman wouldwalk in my woods. But now he has a mindof metal and wheels. He no longer caresfor growing things.
[Pippin and Merry are now on top ofTreebeard and they see a massive armymoving across the land]
[Pippin:]
What is it?

[Merry:]
It s Saruman s army! The war has started.



[Aragorn is floating in the river, unconscious.He is washed ashore and dreams of Arwen.]

[Arwen:]
[Kissing him on the lips] May the graceof the Valar protect you.
[A horse arrives and nudges Aragorn,turning him over and nuzzling him.]

[Aragorn:]
[Mumbles] Brego  [He grabs hold of Brego smane, pulls himself onto the horse andrides slowly to Helms Deep.]
[Arwen is lying on her bed, deep inthought.]
[Elrond:]
[Coming into her room] Arwen.

[Arwen hears him and sits up.]

[Elrond:]
Tollen i l . I chair gwannar na Valannor.Si bado, no c rar. (Arwen, it is time.The ships are leaving for Valinor. Gonow... before it is too late.)
[Arwen:]
I have made my choice.

[Elrond:]
He is not coming back. Why do you lingerhere when there is no hope?
[Arwen:]
There is still hope.

[Elrond:]
[Walks towards window and looks out]If Aragorn survives this war, you willstill be parted. If Sauron is defeated,and Aragorn made king and all that youhope for comes true, you will stillhave to taste the bitterness of mortality.Whether by the sword or the slow decayof time, Aragorn will die.
[Arwen sees a vision of her future asElrond speaks. She is dressed as a queenin mourning garb and looking down uponAragorn, a crown on his brow, And rilin his hand, and dead. Mourners arewalking around the altar, paying theirfinal respects. Arwen is weeping.]

[Elrond:]
And there will be no comfort for you.No comfort to ease the pain of his passing.He will come to death, an image of thesplendor of the kings of men in gloryundimmed before the breaking of theworld.
[The body of Aragorn is now cast asa monument in stone. Arwen stands beforethe monument, veiled and in black.]

[Elrond:]
But you, my daughter, you will lingeron in darkness and in doubt. As nightfallin winter that comes without a star.Here you will dwell, bound to your grief,under the fading trees, until all theworld is changed and the long yearsof your life are utterly spent.
[Still veiled in black, Arwen is walkingalone through the deserted woods ofLothl rien.]
[Elrond:]
[Tuning to Arwen] Arwen... there isnothing for you here, only death.

[The vision ends and Arwen weeps withsadness and fear. Elrond comes to sitbeside his daughter and raises a handto her cheek.]
[Elrond:]
A im,  -'erin veleth l n? (Do I notalso have your love?)
[Arwen:]
[Crying and moving into her father sembrace] Gerich meleth n n, ada. (Youhave my love, father)
[Elves, cloaked and carrying a lanterneach, are setting off from Rivendellon their journey to the West. Elrondlooks on as Arwen leaves with them.Arwen turns back to look at her fatherone last time before she departs. Elrondcontinues to stare after her with anexpression of resigned sadness.]
[Elrond is standing by a window. Hehears Galadriel speaking.]
[Galadriel:]
I amar prestar aen... han mathon nenen, han mathon ne chae a han nostanned gwilith. (The world has changed...I feel it in the water, I feel it inthe earth, I smell it in the air.) Thepower of the enemy is growing. [Sarumanis communicating with Sauron via thePalant r.] Sauron will use his puppetSaruman to destroy the people of Rohan.Isengard has been unleashed. [View ofSaruman's marching army] The eye ofSauron now turns to Gondor, the lastfree kingdom of men. [View of Osgiliath]His war on this country will come swiftly.He senses the Ring is close. The strengthof the Ringbearer is failing. In hisheart, Frodo begins to understand. [Close-upof Galadriel] The quest will claim hislife. You know this. You have foreseenit. It is the risk we all took.
[Close-up of the Ring spinning in slowmotion]
[Galadriel:] (V.O.)
In the gathering dark, the will of theRing grows strong. It works hard nowto find its way back into the handsof men.
[We see Faramir and Gondorian rangerswith the captured Frodo and Sam.]

[Galadriel:] (V.O.)
Men, who are so easily seduced by itspower. The young captain of Gondor hasbut to extend his hands, take the Ringfor his own and the world will fall.It is close now, so close to achievingits goal.
[Faramir and company have reached HennethAnn n. Frodo and Sam and being carries,blinded-folded into the cave.]
[Galadriel:] (V.O.)
For Sauron will have dominion of alllife on this Earth, even unto the endingof the world. The time of the Elvesis over.
[Close-up of Galadriel's luminous eyeswith their deep pools of wisdom. Wethen see Elrond in his library, lookingat the painting of Isildur facing downSauron with the broken blade of Narsil.]

[Galadriel:] (V.O.)
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?Do we let them stand alone?


[Scene returns to Henneth Ann n. Faramiris conferring with his man. They unrolla map.]
FARAMIR
What news?

MADRIL
Our scouts report Saruman has attackedRohan. Theoden s people have fled toHelm s Deep. [Points at the map] Butwe must look to our own borders. Faramir,Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshallingan army. Easterlings and Southrons arepassing through the Black Gate.
FARAMIR
How many?

MADRIL
Some thousands. More come every day.

FARAMIR
Who s covering the river to the north?

MADRIL
We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath, butif the city is attacked, we won t holdit.
FARAMIR
[Tracing on the map] Saruman attacksfrom Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. Thefight will come to men on both fronts.Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike ussoon. And he will strike hard. He knowsnow we do not have the strength to repelhim.
[The hobbits are unbound and blindfoldstaken off them by Damrod and anotherranger. Sam and Frodo find themselvesin a cave behind a waterfall, with Damrodsitting behind them on a rock constantlywatching them. Faramir comes up to themand sits.].
FARAMIR
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

[Sam:]
Spies?! Now wait just a minute!

FARAMIR
Well if you re not spies, then who areyou?
[Frodo and Sam remain silent.]

FARAMIR
Speak.

[Frodo:]
We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Bagginsis my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.

FARAMIR
Your bodyguard?

[Sam:]
His gardener.

FARAMIR
And where is your skulking friend? Thatgangrel creature. He had an ill-favouredlook.
[Frodo:]
[The merest hesitation.] There was noother.
[Sam looks shifty-eyed and uncomfortable.]

[Frodo:]
We set out from Rivendell with sevencompanions. One we lost in M ria. Twowere my kin. A Dwarf there was also,and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, sonof Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.

FARAMIR
[Intently] You re a friend of Boromir?

[Frodo:]
Yes... for my part.

FARAMIR
It will grieve you then to learn thathe is dead.
[Frodo:]
[Shocked] Dead? How? When?

FARAMIR
As one of his companions, I d hopedyou would tell me. [Pause] He was mybrother.


[Faramir is sitting alone, deep in thought.Suddenly someone comes up to him.]

GONDORIAN RANGER
Captain Faramir. [whispers] We foundthe third one.
[Frodo and Sam are sleeping. Frodo awakensas Faramir stands before him.]
FARAMIR
You must come with me. Now.

[Frodo gets up and follow. They cometo the edge of the waterfall, overlookingthe Forbidden Pool.]
FARAMIR
[Pointing down] Down there.

[Frodo looks down and sees Gollum divinginto the water.]
FARAMIR
To enter the forbidden pool bears thepenalty of death. [He gestures to archershidden in the bushes.] They wait formy command.
[The Rangers notch their arrows]

FARAMIR
Shall I shoot?

[Frodo looks stricken. Gollum emergesfrom the pool onto a rock. He holdsa fish in his hand and starts singing,slapping the fish on the rock as hegoes.]
[Gollum:]
[singing] The rock and pool is niceand cool, so juicy sweet! I only wish[Whacks the fish on the rock] to catcha fish [whacks], so juicy sweet! [Thefish almost wriggles out of his graspand he whacks it some more.]
[Faramir has his hand raised to orderhis men to shoot. At the last moment,Frodo calls out.]
[Frodo:]
Wait! [Faramir stops] This creatureis bound to me. And I to him. He isour guide. Please, let me go down tohim.
[Faramir nods. Frodo descends to theForbidden Pool and approaches Gollumwho is gorging on the raw fish.]
[Frodo:]
Smeagol. [Gollum turns round at Frodo svoice.] Master is here. Come, Smeagol.Trust master. Come!
[Frodo gestures for Gollum to followhim.]
[Gollum:]
We must go now?

[Frodo:]
Smeagol, you must trust master. Followme, come on. Come. Come, Smeagol. NiceSmeagol. That s it. Come on.
[With the fish between his teeth, Gollumfollows Frodo warily. Suddenly he looksup in alarm and is caught by Rangers.]

[Frodo:]
Don t hurt him! Smeagol don t struggle!Smeagol listen to me!
[Gollum:]
[wails] Master!!

[A black cloth is brought over Gollum'shead. Frodo stares after them with astricken expression as Faramir leadsGollum and his men away. Back in thecave, Gollum is thrown down to the ground.Crying, he crawls into a corner andcurls up into ball.]
[Gollum:]
No! No!

FARAMIR
Where are you leading them? Answer me!

[Gollum:]
[Cooing, his hand stroking his shoulder]Smeagol... Why does it cry, Smeagol?

[Smeagol:]
[Sobbing] Cruel men hurts us. Mastertrickst us.
[Gollum:]
Of course he did. I told you he wastricksy. I told you he was false.

[Smeagol:]
[Sobbing] Master is our friend... ourfriend.
[Gollum:]
Master betrayed us.

[Smeagol:]
No, not its business. Leave us alone!

[Gollum:]
[Hits his fist against the wall] Filthylittle hobbitses. They stole it fromus.
[Smeagol:]
[Whimpers] No... No!

FARAMIR
What did they steal?

[Gollum:]
[Turns to Faramir with a ferocious expression]Myyy  PRECIOUSSS!! [He bares his teethand growls] Aaaarrrggghhh!!!


[Back in their holding area, Sam andFrodo are alone.]
[Sam:]
We have to get out of here. You go.Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring,Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on.Disappear.
[Frodo:]
I can t. You were right, Sam. You triedto tell me, but  I m sorry. The Ring staking me Sam. If I put it on, he'llfind me. he'll see.
[Sam:]
Mr. Frodo...

[They both stand as Faramir enters.]

FARAMIR
[Unsheathes his sword] So... this isthe answer to all the riddles. Herein the wild I have you. Two halflingsand a host of men at my call. The Ringof power within my grasp.
[Faramir lifts the Ring from Frodo'sneck with the tip of his sword.]
FARAMIR
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,to show his quality.
[Frodo is backed up fearfully againstthe wall. The Ring whispers and Frodofalls into a trance. Suddenly, he grabsthe Ring in his hand and jerks himselfaway.]
[Frodo:]
No!! [He runs away from Faramir]

[Sam:]
Stop it! Leave him alone! Don t youunderstand? He s got to destroy it.That s where we re going. Into Mordor.To the mountain of fire.
[Faramir stares at Frodo. Just thenDamrod enters.]
DAMROD
Osgiliath is under attack. They callfor reinforcements.
[Sam:]
Please. It s such a burden. Will younot help him?
DAMROD
Captain?

FARAMIR
Prepare to leave. The Ring will go toGondor. [He turns to leave.]
[Sam looks after Faramir sadly.]



[Aragorn is riding towards Helm s Deep.On the way, he sees an enormous Uruk-haiarmy marching with great speed. He quicklymakes haste towards Helm s Deep andsoon sees the refuge.]
[Aragorn:]
[Patting Brego on the neck] Mae carnen,Brego, mellon n n. (Well done, Brego,my friend)
[He rides into Helm s Deep to the amazementof all.]
REFUGEES
He s alive!

[Gimli:]
[Pushing his way through the crowd.]Where is he? Where is he? Get out ofthe way. I m gonna kill him! [He seesAragorn.] You are the luckiest, thecanniest and the most reckless man Iever knew! [He hugs Aragorn.] Blessyou, laddie!
[Aragorn:]
Gimli, where is the king?

[Gimli gestures to the hall. As Aragornmakes his way in, he runs into Legolaswho stands waiting.]
[Legolas:]
Le ab-dollen. (You re late.) [They smile.Legolas pauses and looks at Aragorn swounds.] You look terrible.
[To the side,  owyn sees Aragorn andsmiles joyously and with relief. Legolastakes Aragorn s hand and gives the Evenstarpendant. Aragorn looks at the Evenstarand claps Legolas on the shoulder.]

[Aragorn:]
Hannon le. (Thank you.)

[ owyn looks on and smiles even as tearsfill her eyes.]
[Aragorn is in the keep, conferringwith Theoden]
[Theoden:]
A great host, you say?

[Aragorn:]
All Isengard is emptied

[Theoden:]
How many?

[Aragorn:]
Ten thousand strong at least.

[Theoden:]
Ten thousand?!

[Aragorn:]
It is an army bred for a single purpose:to destroy the world of men. They willbe here by nightfall.
[Theoden:]
Let them come! [Walks away resolutely]

[Along the passage behind the DeepingWall.]
[Theoden:]
[to Gamling] I want every man and stronglad able to bear arms to be ready forbattle by nightfall.
[Gamling nods and goes off. Theodenstands at the gate of Helm s Deep, speakingto Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli.]
[Theoden:]
We will cover the causeway and the gatefrom above. No army has ever breachedthe Deeping Wall or set foot insidethe Hornburg.
[Gimli:]
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thickand their shields broad.
[Theoden:]
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.I know how to defend my own keep.

[Gimli seems miffed. Legolas claps ahand on Gimli s shoulder as he followsAragorn and Theoden back in.]
[Theoden:]
They will break upon this fortress likewater on rock. Saruman s hordes willpillage and burn, we ve seen it before.Crops can be resown; homes rebuilt.Within these walls, we will outlastthem.
[Aragorn:]
They do not come to destroy Rohan scrops or villages. They come to destroyits people. Down to the last child.

[Theoden:]
[Draws close to Aragorn] What wouldyou have me do? Look at my men. Theircourage hangs by a thread. If this isto be our end, then I would have themmake such an end as to be worthy ofremembrance.
[Aragorn:]
Send out riders, my lord. You must callfor aid.
[Theoden:]
And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? Weare not so lucky in our friends as you.The old alliances are dead.
[Aragorn:]
Gondor will answer.

[Theoden:]
Gondor? Where was Gondor when the Westfoldfell? Where was Gondor when our enemiesclosed in around us? Where was GonNo, my lord Aragorn, we are alone.[He walks away, calling out orders]Get the women and children into thecaves.
GAMLING
We need more time to lay provisionsfor a siege, lord[Theoden:]
[Cutting him off] There is no time.War is upon us!
ROHAN CAPTAIN
[to the soldiers] Secure the gate!

[Men rush to prepare for battle as flocksof carrion crows circle overhead.]



[Treebeard walks through the forestcarrying Merry and Pippin. He comesto a clearing and stops.]
[Treebeard:]
We Ents have not troubled about thewars of men and wizards for a very longtime. But now something is about tohappen that has not happened for anage... Ent Moot.
[Merry:]
What s that?

[Treebeard:]
'Tis a gathering.

[Merry:]
A gathering of what?

[Merry and Pippin turns round as theyhear movement from the forest aroundthem. They see many more Ents like Treebeardgathering.]
[Treebeard:]
Beech, oak, chestnut, ash... Good, good,good. Many have come. Now we must decideif the Ents will go to war.
[Merry licks his lips in anticipation.]



[Back at Helm s Deep, the women andchildren are being led into the caves.]

SOLDIER 1
Move back! Move to the caves!

SOLDIER 2
Keep moving!

SOLDIER 3
Quickly now!

[Old men and young lads are being draftedfor war. The women and children saytheir tearful and reluctant farewellsas their fathers, husbands and sonsare led away by soldiers. In the armoury,weapons are being distributed. Aragornpicks up a battered sword, looks atit and tosses it back.]
[Aragorn:]
Farmer, farriers, stable boys. Theseare no soldiers.
[Gimli:]
Most have seen too many winters.

[Legolas:]
Or too few. Look at them. They re frightened.I can see it in their eyes. [The menaround them fell silent. Legolas speaksto Aragorn.] Boe a h n: neled heraindan caer menig! (And they should be...Three hundred against ten thousand!)

[Aragorn:]
Si beriathar h n. Amar n  ned Edoras.(They have more hope of defending themselveshere than at Edoras.)
[Legolas:]
Aragorn, men i ndagor. H n  -... ortheri.Natha daged aen! (Aragorn, we are warriors.They cannot win this fight. They areall going to die!)
[Aragorn:]
Then I shall die as one them! [He pausesand then walks away. Legolas makes asif to go after him.]
[Gimli:]
[Puts a hand on Legolas] Let him go,lad. Let him be.


[In the hall]

GAMLING
Every villager able to wield a swordhas been sent to the armory. My lord?

[Theoden:]
Who am I, Gamling?

GAMLING
You are our king, sire.

[Theoden:]
And do you trust your king?

GAMLING
[Puts armour onto Theoden] Your men,my lord, will follow you to whateverend.
[The villagers are handed their weapons.An oversized helmet is placed on a wide-eyedboy. Another stares at the axe thathe is handed with frightened eyes. Anotherchild wearing oversized chain mail takesup a huge shield. Theoden stands insidethe main hall of the keep, his backto the entrance where a bright whitelight is streaming through.]
[Theoden:]
To whatever end  Where is the horseand the rider? Where is the horn thatwas blowing? They have passed like rainon the mountains. Like wind in the meadow.The days have gone down in the west.Behind the hills, into shadow. How didit come to this?


[Everyone is getting ready for war atthe battlements. Aragorn is sittingon the steps. He sees a young lad inarmour holding a sword looking aroundnervously.]
[Aragorn:]
Give me your sword. What is your name?

HALETH
Haleth, son of H ma, my lord. The menare saying that we will not live outthe night. They say that it is hopeless..

[Aragorn gives the battered sword afew swings.]
[Aragorn:]
This is a good sword, Haleth, son ofH ma.
[He hands the sword back to Haleth andleans close to him, putting a hand onhis shoulder.]
[Aragorn:]
There is always hope.



[Back at the armoury, Aragorn dons hisbattle gear. His sword is handed tohim as he reaches for it. He nods andaccepts the sword from Legolas.]
[Legolas:]
We have trusted you this far. You havenot led us astray. Forgive me. I waswrong to despair.
[Aragorn:]
-moe edhored, Legolas. (There is nothingto forgive, Legolas.)
[They smile and clap one another onthe shoulders. They look at Gimli ashe walks up to them, struggling withhis chain mail.]
[Gimli:]
If we had more time I d get this adjusted.[He drops the bundle and the chain maillands with its length right to the floor.]It s a little tight across the chest.

[Aragorn and Legolas bite back smiles.Just then, a horn sounds in the background]

[Legolas:]
That is no Orc horn. [They run out tothe battlements.]
[The guards look down in wonderment.]

BEREG
[to another guard] Send for the king.Open the gate!
SOLDIER
Open the gate!

[An army of Lothl rien Elves march upthe Causeway into the Hornburg. Theyare led by Haldir. The Rohirrim soldierslook upon them in wonderment and delightas they pass.]
[Theoden:]
How is this possible?

HALDIR
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.An alliance once existed between Elvesand men. Long ago we fought and diedtogether. [He looks up to see Aragorn,Legolas and Gimli running down the steps,and smiles] We come to honor that allegiance.

[Aragorn:]
[He bows] Mae govannen, Haldir. (Welcome,Haldir) [He grabs Haldir in a huge embrace.Initially stunned, Haldir hugs him backlightly.]
[Aragorn:]
You are most welcome!

[Legolas and Haldir clasp each otheron the shoulder.]
HALDIR
[Turning to Theoden] We are proud tofight alongside men, once more.
[Men and Elves are in their positionson the battlements of Helm s Deep. Thesounds of a marching army move closerand closer. The women and children inthe caves hear the sounds overhead andare frightened. Mothers draw their childrenclose and try to sooth crying babies.The men and Elves look out into thedarkness, lit by the thousands of torchescarried by the huge advancing Uruk-haiarmy and the light bouncing off theirarmour. With a row of Elf archers, Gimliis standing beside Legolas behind awall, only the top of his helmet visible.]

[Gimli:]
[Grumbling and straining to look abovethe wall.] You could have picked a betterspot.
[Legolas smirks. Aragorn approachesand stands beside them]
[Gimli:]
Well lad, whatever luck you live by,let s hope it lasts the night.
[Thunder sounds and lightning flashes,revealing the sea of approaching Uruk-hai.]

[Legolas:]
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

[Gimli:]
Let s hope they last the night.

[The marching and thumping grows louderand louder. Lightning flashes and itbegins to rain. While the Uruk-hai armycontinues to march at the fortress,an Uruk-hai leader steps on a rock outcrop.]

[Aragorn is giving commands to the Elfwarriors.]
[Aragorn:]
A Eruch n,  -dano i faelas a hyn anuben tanatha le faelas! (Show them nomercy! For you shall receive none!)

[The Uruk-hai leader raises his swordsand commands his army to stop with aterrifying animalic cry. The Uruks stopand growl in anticipation of the upcomingbattle and slaughter]
[Gimli:]
[Jumping and straining to see] What shappening out there?
[Legolas:]
Shall I describe it to you? [Looks atGimli with a grin] Or would you likeme to find you a box?
[Gimli:]
[Laughs good-naturedly] Hehehehe!!

[The Uruk Leader cries out once, encouragingthe Uruk-hai to start roaring and thumpingtheir spears furiously.The women andchildren in the caves huddle togetherin fear. Suddenly, Aldor, the old mannext to Haleth, loses his grip and releaseshis arrow prematurely, shooting an Uruk-haiin the neck.]
[Aragorn:]
Dartho! (Hold!)

[The Uruk-hai army stop their roaringand thumping. With a hollow groan, theUruk that was shot collapsed to theground. The other Uruk-hai bare theirteeth and roar with anger. With a cry,the Uruk-hai leader thrusts his weaponin the air and the Uruk-hai army startscharging.]
[Theoden:]
So it begins.

[Aragorn:]
Tangado halad! (Prepare to fire!)

[The Elves notch their arrow and aim.]

[Legolas:]
Faeg i-varv d n na lanc a nu ranc. (Theirarmor is weak at the neck and beneaththe arms.)
[Aragorn:]
Leithio i philinn! (Release the arrows!)

[Arrows rain down on the Uruk-hai below,killing many.]
[Gimli:]
Did they hit anything?

[Theoden:]
Give them a volley.

GAMLING
[to the men] Fire!



MAN-WITH-MISSING-EYE
Fire!



[More arrows are released. But the Uruk-haiarmy keep advancing, with more replacingthose fallen.]
[Aragorn:]
Fire!

[Gimli:]
[Impatiently] Send them to me! C mon!

[The Uruk-hai start to load laddersonto the walls, pushing them up withtheir long spears.]
[Aragorn:]
Pendraid! (Ladders!)

[The Elves draw their blades in preparationfor combat. The first ladders are almostreaching the walls with big nasty UrukBerserkers on top of them.]
[Aragorn:]
Swords! Swords!

[Gimli:]
Good!

[Close combat begins as the Uruk-haiclimb over the wall.]
[Gimli:]
Legolas, two already! [Holding up twofingers]
[Legolas:]
I m on seventeen!

[Gimli:]
[Outraged] Argh! I ll have no pointy-earoutscoring me! [He turns to a Uruk justclimbing over the wall, whacking itin the groin with his axe and killingit as it falls.]
[Legolas:]
[Fires two arrows] Nineteen!



[The Ent Moot is still in progress.The Ents sway a little as they continueto deliberate. Merry and Pippin aresitting a distance away. Suddenly, Treebeardnods and turns to the hobbits.]
[Pippin:]
[Gesturing] Merry!

[Treebeard:]
We have just agreed. [Long pause withhis eyes closed.]
[Merry:]
[Angles his head in query] Yes?

[Treebeard:]
I have told your names to the Ent mootand we have agreed   you are not Orcs.

[Pippin:]
Well, that s good news.

[Merry:]
[impatiently] And what about Saruman?Have you come to a decision about HIM?

[Treebeard:]
[Waving a hand] Now don t be hasty,Master Meriadoc.
[Merry:]
Hasty? Our friends are out there! Theyneed our help! They cannot fight thiswar on their own.
[Treebeard:]
War, yes  It affects us all. But youmust understand, young hobbit. It takesa loong time to say anything in oooldEntish. [Merry and Pippin roll theireyes in disgruntlement.] And we neversay anything  unless it is worth takinga looong  time to say.


[Gimli is standing on the wall betweentwo ladders, hacking away at Uruk-haias they come up]
[Gimli:]
Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty!Twenty-one! Twenty-two!
[Camera pans over the Uruk-hai belowand turns to the Causeway. A group ofUruk-hai is advancing on the Causewaytowards the gate in tortoise formation,using their broad shields to block offattacks.]
[Aragorn:]
Na fennas! (Causeway!) [Directs theElf archers to aim at the Uruk-hai column.]

[The Elf archers release their arrows.The Uruk-hai at the sides are shot andfall down the Causeway. But the columnkeeps advancing.]
[Theoden:]
Is this it? Is this all you can conjure,Saruman?
[At the bottom of the Deeping Wall,two spiky bombs are lodge in the sluicegate. The rest opens a path and an Uruk-haicarrying a torch starts to run towardsthe sluice gate. Aragorn spots the Uruk-hai.]

[Aragorn:]
Togo hon dad, Legolas! (Bring him down,Legolas!) [Legolas shoots the Uruk-haiin the shoulder but the latter keepsgoing] Dago hon! Dago hon! (Kill him!Kill him!)
[Legolas shoots the Uruk again. It stumblesand then throws it self and the torchat the bombs. An enormous explosionis set off, blowing away a large partof the wall. Rock, debris and bodiesare thrown up. Aragorn is also thrownback by the force of the explosion andon the ground, knocked out. Theodenlooks on in shock as the Uruk-hai streamsin past the Deeping Walls.]
[Theoden:]
Brace the Gate! Hold them! Stand firm!

[Gimli sees the Uruk-hai charging inwith Aragorn in their path. With a cry,he jumps down from the wall and landson the Uruk-hai army, taking them outas he stands.]
[Gimli:]
Aragorn!! Argh!

[He is soon overpowered. Aragorn getsup and sees Gimli falling.]
[Aragorn:]
Gimli! [He yells to the Elves behindhim] Hado i philinn! (Hurl the arrows!)

[The arrows take out the first groupof Uruk-hai coming through the holein the wall.]
[Aragorn:]
Herio! (Charge!)

[Aragorn leads the Elves in a chargetowards the Uruk-hai streaming in. Herushes to Gimli s side and picks himup. At the top of the battlements, Legolasgrabs a shield and sends it slidingacross the ground. He then hops ontoit and surfs down the steps, releasingthree arrows as he goes, and kickingthe shield to stab an Uruk-hai as helands at the bottom.]


[At the Ent Moot]

[Treebeard:]
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.We must weather such things as we havealways done.
[Merry:]
How can that be your decision?!

[Treebeard:]
This is not our war.

[Merry:]
But you're part of this world! Aren'tyou?! [The Ents look at one another,taken back] You must help, please! Youmust do something!
[Treebeard:]
You are young and brave, Master Merry.But your part in this tale is over.Go back to your home.
[Merry is putting on his jacket. Pippinapproaches him slowly]
[Pippin:]
Maybe Treebeard s right. We don t belonghere, Merry. It's too big for us. Whatcan we do in the end? We've got theShire. Maybe we should go home.
[Merry:]
[Looking into the distance.] The firesof Isengard will spread. And the woodsof Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.And all that was once green and goodin this world will be gone. [Turns toPippin and puts a hand on his shoulder]There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
[Pippin looks after Merry as he walksaway.]


GAMLING
Aragorn! Fall back to the Keep! Getyour men out of there!
[Aragorn:]
Na Barad! Na Baraad! Haldir, na Barad!(To the Keep! Pull back to the Keep!Haldir, to the Keep!)
[Haldir nods and turns back. Gimli isbeing carried away, kicking and strugglingas he goes]
[Gimli:]
[Protesting] What are you doing? Argh!What are you stopping for!
[HALDIR HACKS AT A FEW URUK AS HE TURNS TOWARDSTHE GATE. SUDDENLY, HE IS STABBED IN HIS ARM.]

With a grimace, he kills the Uruk-haiand looks down as his wound in seemingdisbelief. An Uruk-hai comes up frombehind him unnoticed and slices himon the neck. As Haldir goes down, helooks around him and sees his kin fallenamong dead Uruk-hai.]
[Aragorn:]
[Sees Haldir falling] HALDIR!! [He runsup the steps to Haldir s side and catcheshim and he collapses. Haldir's headrolls back, his eyes empty and unseeing.Aragorn bows his head in grief. Thenwith a cry, he jumps onto a ladder andswings down to the ground, killing ashe goes.]
GAMLING
Brace the gate!

SOLDIER
Hold them!

[Theoden:]
[Drawing his sword] To the gate! Drawyour swords!
[Theoden and his commanders come tothe gate, which is under heavy attack.The Uruk-hai are knocking down the gateand hacking through the broken wood.Theoden stabs at an Uruk-hai and receivesa lance in his shoulder, blocked byhis armour. Grimacing in pain, Theodencontinues to stab at the Uruk untilled away by Gamling.]
GAMLING
Make way! We cannot hold much longer.

[Theoden:]
Hold them!

[Aragorn:]
[Runs up and stabs away at the Uruk-haithrough the broken gate] How long doyou need?
GAMLING
Brace the gate!

[Theoden:]
As long as you can give me!

[Aragorn:]
Gimli!

THEODEN
Timbers! Brace the Gate!

[Aragorn and Gimli slip out a side exitand stand on a ledge just to the sideof the main gate. Aragorn peeks over,seeing the large band of Uruk-hai stormingthe gate.]
[Gimli:]
Come on! We can take 'em!

[Aragorn:]
It s a long way.

[Gimli takes a peek and then steps back.]

[Gimli:]
[Mumbles] Toss me.

[Aragorn:]
What?

[Gimli:]
I cannot jump the distance! You ll haveto toss me!
[Aragorn nods slowly and then turnsto grab the Dwarf.]
[Gimli:]
Oh! [Gimli stays Aragorn s hand] Don ttell the Elf.
[Aragorn:]
Not a word.

[He tosses Gimli to the head of theCauseway and then leaps over.]
[Gimli:]
[Making quick work of killing the Uruk-hai]ARGH!!
[On the other side of the gate]

[Theoden:]
Shore up the door!

SOLDIER 1
Make way!

SOLDIER 2
Follow me to the barricade.

SOLDIER 3
Watch our backs!

SOLDIER 4
Throw another one over here!

[Theoden:]
Higher!

[Men are bracing the gate with woodand nails. Aragorn and Gimli continueto fight off the Uruk-hai just outside.Meanwhile the Uruk-hai load and firesenormous hooks over the battlements.Hundred of Uruk-hai climb onto super-laddersas they are pulled up towards the walls,the super-ladders locking onto the edgeof the battlements with their steelgrips. Legolas takes aim as anothersuper-ladder is being pulled up andshoots away one of the ropes. The ladderfalls back onto the Uruk-hai army.]

SOLDIER
Hold fast the gate!]

[Theoden:]
[Through a crack in the gate] Gimli!Aragorn! Get out of there!
[Legolas calls to them from the topof the battlements]
[Legolas:]
Aragorn! [He throws them a rope]

[Aragorn grabs Gimli in one hand andthe rope with the other as they arepulled up the wall. Just then the Uruk-haiload and fires enormous hooks over thebattlements. Hundred of Uruk-hai climbonto super-ladders as they are pulledup towards the walls, the super-ladderslocking onto the edge of the battlementswith their steel grips. Legolas takesaim as another super-ladder is beingpulled up and shoots away one of theropes. The ladder falls back onto theUruk-hai army.]
[Theoden:]
Pull everybody back! Pull them back!

GAMLING
Fall back! Fall back!

[Theoden:]
They've broken through! The castle isbreached. Retreat!
GAMLING
Fall back!

[Theoden:]
Retreat!

[Aragorn:]
Hurry! Inside! Get them inside!

GAMLING
Into the Keep!

[They all run towards the keep, Legolasfiring two arrows into the Uruk-haiarmy as he goes.]


[Treebeard is walking through the forest,carrying Merry and Pippin. The hobbitslook dejected.]
[Treebeard:]
I will leave you at the western bordersof the forest. You can make your waynorth to your homeland from there.

[Pippin suddenly looks up with a gleamin his eyes.]
[Pippin:]
Wait! Stop! Stop! [Treebeard comes toa stop.] Turn around. Turn around. Takeus south!
[Treebeard:]
South? But that will lead you past Isengard.

[Pippin:]
Yes. Exactly. If we go south we canslip past Saruman unnoticed. The closerwe are to danger, the farther we arefrom harm. It s the last thing he'llexpect.
[Treebeard:]
Mmmm. That doesn't make sense to me.But then, you are very small. Perhapsyou re right. South it is then. Holdon, little Shirelings. I always likegoing south. Somehow it feels like goingdown hill.
[Merry:]
Are you mad? We'll be caught!

[Pippin:]
No we won t. Not this time.



[Faramir and company draws close toOsgiliath.]
RANGER 1
Look! Osgiliath burns!

RANGER 2
Mordor has come.

[Frodo:]
[With tears in his eyes] The Ring willnot save Gondor. It has only the powerto destroy. Please, let me go.
[Faramir hesitates for a moment.]

FARAMIR
Hurry. [He presses them on]

[Frodo:]
Faramir, you must let me go!

[Frodo and Sam are pushed on towardsOsgiliath]


[Treebeard, Merry and Pippin come tothe southern edge of the forest.]

[Treebeard:]
And a little family of field mice thatclimb up sometimes and they tickle meawfully. They re always trying to getsomewhere where they   Oh!! [He seesthe desolated landscape of tree stumpsthat used to be forested grounds] Manyof these trees were my friends. CreaturesI had known from nut and acorn.
[Pippin:]
I m sorry, Treebeard.

[Treebeard:]
[With tears in his eyes] They had voicesof their own. [His gaze turns to thetreeless Isengard and its smoking caverns]Saruman! A wizard should know better!

[He lets out a ferocious roar that echoesthrough the forest]
[Treebeard:]
There is no curse in Elvish, Entishor the tongues of men for this treachery.My business is with Isengard tonight.With rock and stone!
[Merry and Pippin turn around as theyhear rumbles from the forest. They seemany Ents emerging and marching towardsthem]
[Merry:]
Yes!

[Treebeard:]
Hoorarooom... Come my friends. The Entsare going to war. It is likely thatwe go to our doom. Last march of theEnts!


[Osgiliath is still under siege as Faramirand company arrives, dodging arrowsand falling rocks.]
MADRIL
Faramir, Orcs have taken the easternshore. Their numbers are too great.By nightfall we ll be overrun.
[Frodo suddenly seems stricken]

[Sam:]
Mr. Frodo!

[Frodo:]
It s calling to him, Sam. His eye isalmost on me.
[Sam:]
Hold on, Mr. Frodo  You'll be alright...

[Frodo sees that Sam is speaking tohim but he hears nothing. His sensesare overcome.]
FARAMIR
Take them to my father. Tell him Faramirsends a mighty gift. A weapon that willchange our fortunes in this war.
[Sam breaks away as they are being ledaway.]
[Sam:]
Do you want to know what happened toBoromir? You want to know why your brotherdied? He tried to take the Ring fromFrodo! After swearing an oath to protecthim, he tried to kill him! The Ringdrove your brother mad!
RANGER
Watch out!

[A boulder crashes into a tower overheadand shatters it. Suddenly, Frodo s eyesroll up and he stares at Faramir strangely.]

[Sam:]
Mr. Frodo?

[Frodo:]
[In a faraway voice] They re here. They'vecome.
FARAMIR
[Looking up] NAZG L!! [He grabs thehobbits and thrusts them into a corner.]Stay here. Keep out of sight. [To hismen] Take cover!


[Banners of the White Hand are flyingfrom the battlements of Helm s Deep.The Hornburg is overrun with Uruk-hai.Theoden and company are in the hallof the keep.]
[Theoden:]
The fortress is taken. It is over.

[Aragorn:]
[Carrying a table with Legolas to shoreup the door of the hall] You said thisfortress would never fall while yourmen defend it! They still defend it!They have died defending it!
[In the Glittering Caves, the womenand children cry in fear as they hearthe battering ram banging on the door.]

WOMAN
They are breaking in!
[Aragorn:]
Is there no other way for the womenand children to get out of the caves?[There is no answer.] Is there no otherway?
GAMLING
There is one passage. It leads intothe mountains. But they will not getfar. The Uruk-hai are too many.
[Aragorn:]
Send word for the women and childrento make for the mountain pass. And barricadethe entrance.
[Theoden:]
So much death. What can men do againstsuch reckless hate?
[Aragorn:]
[Pause] Ride out with me. Ride out andmeet them.
[Theoden:]
[A light of determination shines inhis eyes] For death and glory.
[Aragorn:]
For Rohan. For your people.

[Gimli:]
The sun is rising.

[Aragorn looks up at a window to seefaint light streaming through. He recallsGandalf's words.]
[Gandalf:] (V.O.)
"Look to my coming at first light onthe fifth day. At dawn, look to theeast."
[Theoden:]
Yes. Yes! The horn of Helm Hammerhandshall sound in the deep one last time!

[Gimli:]
Yes! [Gimli runs up the steps to thehorn of Helm Hammerhand]
[Theoden:]
Let this be the hour when we draw swordstogether. Fell deeds awake. Now forwrath! Now for ruin! And a red dawn!

[He mounts his horse and puts on hishelmet. The sound of the horn rumblesthrough Helm's Deep as Gimli blows withgusto.]
[Theoden:]
FORTH EORLINGAS!!

[Theoden leads the charge out of thekeep into the Hornburg, slashing awayat the Uruk-hai as they go. Withoutpause, they storm out of the gate anddown the Causeway, right into the columnof waiting Uruk-hai. In the midst ofbattle, Aragorn looks east and seesa white rider against the rising sun]

[Aragorn:]
Gandalf.

[Gandalf:]
"Theoden king stands alone."

OMER
[Coming up from behind] Not alone. [Heraises a hand] Rohirrim!!
[Riders move up behind  omer.]

[Theoden:]
[Looking to the east]  omer!

OMER
To the king!

[The Rohirrim and the White Rider chargedown the slope. Half the Uruk-hai armyturns to face the challenge, bearingtheir spears down towards the riders.As the riders draw closer, the sun risesbehind them, momentarily blinding theUruk-hai who raise the hands (and spears)to shield their eyes. The riders crashright into the Uruk-hai and engage themin battle.]


[The Ents are stomping over Isengard,swinging their huge limbs, throwingand stamping on Orcs and rolling hugeboulders over the ground. An Ent ispulled down with chains by some Orcs,who immediately jump on and hacks awayat his wooden limbs. Saruman rushesout onto the balcony of Orthanc andstares at the pandemonium in incredulity.Merry and Pippin also throws stonesat Orcs, their aims true.]
[Pippin:]
Yes!

[Treebeard:]
A hit. A fine hit!

[Two Ents rock a wooden structure andpush it over into the caverns below,smashing against the rock. Some Orcsfire flamed-tipped arrows at an Ent,setting him on fire. Saruman continuesto look about from his balcony, helpless.Some Ents are now breaking away at adam.]
[Treebeard:]
Break the dam! Release the river!

[The dam is broken and Saruman looksup to see the river rushing down theslope towards Isengard, washing awayOrcs and wooden structures in its path.]
[Merry:]
Pippin, hold on! [The hobbits tightentheir hold on top of Treebeard]
[Treebeard:]
Hold on, little hobbits!

[Treebeard braces himself against theflood. As the water rushes over Isengard,an Ent rushes in and thrusts his burningbody into the water. The water rushesinto the caverns, washing away the bridges,mechanisms and structures within.]



[Frodo walks slowly away from the safecorner. Gondorian Rangers are stillrunning about, defending their stations.]

[Sam:]
What are you doing? Where are you going?!

[SLOW MOTION
Frodo walks up some stairs and standson a bridge. A Nazgul on a Fell beastemerges in front of him. Frodo staresat the Nazgul, fixated. Feeling thecall of the Ring, he holds it up. Faramirwatches the unfolding tableau from below.As Frodo moves to put the Ring on hisfinger and the Nazgul flies closer andcloser, Sam runs up and knocks Frodoover. Faramir releases an arrow andshoots the Fell Beast. Frodo and Samroll down the stairs. As they come toa stop at the bottom, Frodo holds Samin a death grip, yells and points Stingat his throat, his eyes livid with madnessand anger that someone would try totake the Ring away.]
[Frodo:]
Aaarrgghh!!!

[Sam:]
[With tears running down his face] It sme. It s your Sam. Don t you know yourSam?
[The madness fades and recognition returnsto Frodo s eyes. He realizes what henearly did and is overcome. Stumblingbackwards, he collapses against a walland Sting falls to the ground with aclang. Sam gets up slowly.]
[Frodo:]
[Slowly and with despair] I can t dothis, Sam.
[Sam:]
[Getting up slowly] I know. It s allwrong. By rights we shouldn't even behere. But we are. [He stands and leansagainst a wall, looking out into thedistance.] It s like in the great stories,Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered.Full of darkness and danger they were.And sometimes you didn't want to knowthe end. Because how could the end behappy? [Images of the riders winningthe battle against the Uruk-hai at Helm sDeep] How could the world go back tothe way it was when so much bad hadhappened?
[Theoden:]
Victory! We have victory! [He raiseshis sword with a victorious cry]
[Sam:]
But in the end, it s only a passingthing, this shadow. [The women and childrenwelcome the men as they return.  Eowynruns up to Aragorn and embraces him,crying tears of relief.] Even darknessmust pass. A new day will come. [Isengardis flooded. Merry and Pippin looks onfrom their perch on Treebeard. On thebalcony, Saruman stumbles back intohis chamber] And when the sun shinesit will shine out the clearer. Thosewere the stories that stayed with you.That meant something, even if you weretoo small to understand why. But I think,Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now.Folk in those stories had lots of chancesof turning back only they didn't. Theykept going because they were holdingon to something.
[Frodo:]
What are we holding on to, Sam?

[Sam:]
There s some good in this world, Mr.Frodo. And it s worth fighting for.

[Standing in a corner, even Gollum seemsmoved. Faramir walks over and comesto kneel in front of Frodo]
FARAMIR
I think at last we understand one another,Frodo Baggins.
MADRIL
You know the laws of our country, thelaws of your father. If you let themgo, your life will be forfeit.
FARAMIR
Then it is forfeit. Release them.

[Sam shakes the ranger s hand from hisshoulder. Frodo looks up at Faramirwith gladness. Over in the realm ofRohan, Gandalf, Theoden and companyride to the top of a slope, lookingtowards the Mountain of Fire in thedistance.]
[Gandalf:]
"Sauron's wrath will be terrible, hisretribution swift. The battle for Helm'sDeep is over. The battle for Middle-earthis about to begin. All our hopes nowlie with two little hobbits. Somewherein the wilderness."
[Frodo and Sam are walking through thewoods, away from Osgiliath.]
[Sam:]
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songsor tales.
[Frodo:]
What?

[Sam:]
I wonder if people will ever say,  let shear about Frodo and the Ring.  Andthey'll say  yes, that s one of my favoritestories. Frodo was really courageous,wasn't he, dad.   Yes, my boy, the mostfamousest of hobbits. And that's sayingalot.[Frodo:]
Huh, you left out one of the chief charactersSamwise the Brave. I want to hearmore about Sam.
[Frodo turns to look at Sam.]

[Frodo:]
Frodo wouldn't have got far withoutSam.
[Sam:]
Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.I was being serious.
[Frodo:]
[smiling] So was I. [He turns to walkon]
[Sam:]
[Dreamily] Samwise the Brave. [He giveshis backpack a heave and follows Frodo]

[Gollum is crouching a short distanceaway]
[Frodo:]
Smeagol!

[Sam:]
