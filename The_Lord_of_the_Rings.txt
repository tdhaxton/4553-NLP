FADE IN:
1 EXT. HOBBITON - DAY 1
WIDE ON: The sun rises over the village of HOBBITON. A
dense, orange glow is cast against the LITTLE RIVERS and
ROLLING HILLS.
2 EXT. BAG END - HOBBITON - DAY 2
CLOSE ON: A SMOKE RING floats in the morning sky. It wavers
gently in the wind, tranquil.
Suddenly, it collapses with a POP and transforms into a
SMOKE MOTH.
The moth FLUTTERS into the face of curly-haired hobbit BILBO
BAGGINS. The puff of smoke wakes him from his reverie. He
notices a grey figure standing in front of him.
WIDE ON: The wizard GANDALF THE GREY stands before Bilbo's
FENCE, watching.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo seems startled.
[Bilbo:]
Good morning.
[Gandalf:]
What do you mean? Do you mean to
wish me a good morning, or do you
mean that it is a good morning
whether I want it or not? Or,
perhaps you mean to say that you
feel good on this particular
morning, or are you simply stating
that this is a morning to be good
on?
[Bilbo:]
All of them at once, I suppose?
Gandalf gives Bilbo a disapproving look. Bilbo looks simply
bewildered.

2 CONTINUED: 2
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
I'm sorry, can I help you?
[Gandalf:]
That remains to be seen. I'm
looking for someone to share in an
adventure.
Bilbo's PIPE drops from his mouth.
[Bilbo:]
An adventure? Now I don't imagine
anyone west of Bree would have much
interest in adventures. Nasty,
disturbing, uncomfortable things.
Make you late for dinner!
WIDE ON: Bilbo gets up and checks his mailbox.
ANGLE ON: He grabs some LETTERS and ENVELOPES and sorts
through them. After sparing Gandalf a brief glance, he turns
to leave.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
Good morning.
[Gandalf:]
To think that I should have lived
to be good-morninged by Belladonna
Took's son as if I were selling
buttons at the door.
Bilbo whips around, startled at the mention of his mother.
[Bilbo:]
Beg your pardon?
[Gandalf:]
You've changed, and not entirely
for the better, Bilbo Baggins.
[Bilbo:]
I'm sorry, do I know you?
[Gandalf:]
Well, you know my name, although
you don't remember I belong to it.
I'm Gandalf and Gandalf means me!
A look of recognition flashes across Bilbo's face. His lips
curl into a smile.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 3.
2 CONTINUED: (2) 2
[Bilbo:]
Not Gandalf, the wandering wizard,
who made such excellent fireworks!
Old Took used to have them on
Mid-Summer's Eve!
(beat)
I had no idea you were still in
business.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf gives Bilbo a scathing look.
[Gandalf:]
And where else should I be?
[Bilbo:]
Well...
Bilbo's voice awkwardly TRAILS OFF. Sheepish, Bilbo takes
another whiff of his pipe.
[Gandalf:]
Well, I'm pleased to find you
remember something about me, even
if it's only my fireworks. Well
then, that's decided. It will be
very good for you and most amusing
for me. I shall inform the others.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo grows pale with shock. He retreats further
towards Bag End.
[Bilbo:]
Inform the who? What? No, no, no!
We do not want any adventures here,
thank you! Not today! I suggest you
try somewhere over the hill or
across the water! Good morning!
In frustration, Bilbo storms into his home.
3 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - DAY 3
WIDE ON: Bilbo bolts the door shut behind him. Relieved, he
leans on it, catching his breath.
Suddenly, he hears a mysterious SCRAPPING NOISE on his door.
Bilbo listens closely, WONDERING.
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 4.
4 EXT. BAG END - HOBBITON - DAY 4
CLOSE ON: The noise is Gandalf, drawing a GLOWING RUNE onto
Bilbo's door with the edge of his STAFF.
5 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - DAY 5
Alarmed, Bilbo rushes to his window. He peers outside and
sees nothing but blue sky.
Suddenly, Gandalf's EYE is staring back at him through the
glass. Bilbo jumps back in fright, hiding out of sight.
Gandalf lingers outside the window, before turning and
leaving. Bilbo reenters the hallway and looks out of the
window. He sees Gandalf hurrying away from Bag End.
6 EXT. MARKETPLACE - HOBBITON - DAY 6
WIDE ON: Bilbo scurries toward the marketplace, a crazed
look in his eyes.
Numerous TENTS AND PAVILIONS are set up around the market.
Under their roofs, FOOD, DRINK, AND OTHER ITEMS are sold.
DOZENS OF HOBBITS waltz around the site, CHATTERING amongst
themselves. The women laugh, the men drink and the children
play.
ANGLE ON: A FISHERHOBBIT hands Bilbo his PACKAGED GOODS.
[Bilbo:]
Thank you.
Bilbo hurries away from the marketplace, eager to return
home. Just to be sure, Bilbo peers over his shoulder.
Nothing is there.
He looks back to the road before him, finding an elderly
hobbit, MASTER WORRYWORT, wheeling a cart towards him.
Worrywort pauses when he sees Bilbo.
[Worrywort:]
Hello, Mr. Bilbo! Here!
Worrywort holds up a LARGE, ROUND PLANT in front of Bilbo.
[Worrywort:] (CONT'D)
Have a feel of me tubers. Nice and
firm they are. Just came in from
West Farthing!
Bilbo gives the plant a brief touch.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 5.
6 CONTINUED: 6
[Bilbo:]
Very impressive, Master Worrywort.
Now, I don't suppose you've seen a
wizard lurking about these parts?
[Worrywort:]
Tall fellow, long grey beard,
pointy hat. Can't say I have.
As Worrywort speaks, Bilbo spots the TIP OF A GREY HAT
moving behind a tent.
He sprints away from the marketplace, leaving Worrywort
behind. Bilbo hides himself next to a STONE BRIDGE, watching
as the hat makes its way past the tent.
The hat rounds a corner. It was only a BASKET OF GREY WOOL.
Bilbo steps out from the bridge, dazed.
7 EXT. BAG END - HOBBITON - NIGHT 7
WIDE ON: The sun creeps beneath the trees. One single, DRUNK
HOBBIT stumbles past Bag End, carrying a FLAGON OF WINE in
his hand.
SUPER: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY
8 INT. KITCHEN - BAG END - NIGHT 8
CLOSE ON: Two fish SIZZLE on a frying pan.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo loads them onto his plate, dressed in his
night-time robes. He settles down at the table, tucks a
napkin into his collar and begins to season his meal.
9 EXT. BAG END - HOBBITON - NIGHT 9
CLOSE ON: The rune on the door GLIMMERS in the night. The
SHADOW OF A DWARF spreads over the door.
10 INT. KITCHEN - BAG END - NIGHT 10
WIDE ON: From outside, the DOORBELL RINGS. Bilbo looks up in
surprise.
11 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - NIGHT 11
ANGLE ON: Bilbo opens his door. He finds a bald, muscular
dwarf, DWALIN, standing at his doorstep. He greets Bilbo
with a slight bow.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 6.
11 CONTINUED: 11
[Dwalin:]
Dwalin, at your service.
Bilbo lets out a CONFUSED WHIMPER. Coming to his senses, he
quickly ties his robe together and stands taller, but the
confused look on his face still remains.
[Bilbo:]
Bilbo Baggins, at yours.
Dwalin steps inside without invitation.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
Sorry, do we know each other?
[Dwalin:]
No. Which way, laddie? Is it down
here?
[Bilbo:]
Is what down where?
Dwalin takes off his COAT and throws it to Bilbo. The poor
hobbit barely manages to catch the thing.
[Dwalin:]
Supper. He said there'd be food and
lots of it.
The dwarf strides down the hallway, as if it were his own.
Bilbo stares after him, befuddled.
[Bilbo:]
He said? Who said?
12 INT. KITCHEN - BAG END - NIGHT 12
Dwalin sits at Bilbo's spot at the table, scarfing down the
fish. Bilbo watches him eat, disgusted.
CLOSE ON: Dwalin scarfs down all the flesh off from the
fish. He drops the BONES onto the plate, wiping his hands on
his beard.
[Dwalin:]
Very good, this. Any more?
[Bilbo:]
What? Oh, yes.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 7.
12 CONTINUED: 12
ANGLE ON: Bilbo awkwardly brings over a PLATE OF BISCUITS.
He manages to hide one behind his back for himself.
Dwalin grabs most of the biscuits and stuffs them down his
mouth.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
It's just that I wasn't expecting
company.
CLOSE ON: The DOORBELL RINGS once again. Bilbo looks up in
alarm.
[Dwalin:]
That'll be the door.
Dwalin stares up at him, GREASE staining his beard.
13 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - NIGHT 13
ANGLE ON: Bilbo opens the door once again. He finds another
dwarf standing before him. BALIN. The much older dwarf gives
a ginger bow.
[Balin:]
Balin, at your service.
[Bilbo:]
Good evening.
[Balin:]
Yes, yes, it is. Though, I think it
might rain later. Am I late?
[Bilbo:]
Late for what?
Balin spots Dwalin in the hallway, trying to get more
biscuits from the JAR.
[Balin:]
Oh! Evening brother!
Dwalin puts the jar down with a smile. The two brothers
approach each other.
[Dwalin:]
By my beard, you are shorter and
wider than last we met.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 8.
13 CONTINUED: 13
[Balin:]
Wider, not shorter. But sharp
enough for the both of us.
CLOSE ON: The two share a CHUCKLE as Bilbo looks on,
confused.
14 INT. PANTRY - BAG END - NIGHT 14
ANGLE ON: Dwalin and Balin have gone into the pantry,
helping themselves to ALE and examining the FOOD.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo steps into the room.
[Bilbo:]
It's not that I don't like
visitors, I like visitors as much
as the next hobbit. But I do like
to know them before they come
visiting.
ANGLE ON: The dwarves continue to riffle through the pantry,
ignoring their host.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo sheepishly presses on.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
The thing is, I don't know any of
you. Not in the slightest. I don't
mean to be blunt, but I had to
speak my mind. I'm sorry.
Dwalin and Balin pause and look at Bilbo.
[Balin:]
Apology accepted.
Bilbo nods, satisfied.
ANGLE ON: Balin hands a TANKARD to his brother.
[Balin:] (CONT'D)
Now, fill it up, brother, don't
stint!
From the hallway, the DOORBELL RINGS once again. Bilbo
slowly turns around, at awe with shock.
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 9.
15 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - NIGHT 15
ANGLE ON: For the third time, Bilbo opens the door. He finds
two young dwarves, FILI and KILI, standing before him. Bilbo
GROANS.
[Fili:]
Fili.
[Kili:]
And Kili.
(with Fili)
At your service.
They both give a courteous bow.
[Kili:] (CONT'D)
You must be Mr. Boggins!
[Bilbo:]
Nope, you can't come in, you've
come to the wrong house.
Bilbo tries to close the door. Kili manages to stop it with
his feet.
[Kili:]
Has it been cancelled?
[Fili:]
No one told us!
[Bilbo:]
Cancelled? No, nothing's been
cancelled!
[Kili:]
That's a relief!
The dwarves push their way in and begin to unload their
WEAPONS onto Bilbo.
[Fili:]
Careful with these. We just had
them sharpened.
Kili admires the architecture of the hallway.
[Kili:]
It's nice, this place. Did you do
it yourself?
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 10.
15 CONTINUED: 15
[Bilbo:]
No, it's been in the family for
years.
Kili begins to scrape the mud off his boots on the edge of a
NEARBY CHEST.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
That's my mother's glory box, could
you please not do that!
Dwalin enters the hallway and beckons Fili and Kili forward.
[Dwalin:]
Fili, Kili, come on, give us a
hand!
[Kili:]
Mr. Dwalin!
The two brothers follow Dwalin down the hall and into the
dining room. Bilbo begins to follow behind them, at a loss
for words.
[Balin:] (O.S.)
Let's shove this in the hallway,
otherwise we'll never get everyone
in.
[Bilbo:]
Everyone? How many more are there.
[Balin:] (O.S.)
Not many.
The DOORBELL RINGS AGAIN!
Enraged, Bilbo quickly walks to the door. Along the way, he
dumps the swords and equipment he is carrying onto the
ground.
[Bilbo:]
No! There's nobody home! Go away
and bother somebody else! There's
far too many dwarves in my dining
room as it is. If this is some
clotterd's idea of a joke, I can
only say that it is in very poor
taste.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 11.
15 CONTINUED: (2) 15
Bilbo throws open the door. Two more dwarves stand outside,
OIN and GLOIN. Bilbo is shocked to see Gandalf standing
behind them.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
Gandalf?
The wizard gives a faint smile.
16 INT. PANTRY - BAG END - NIGHT 16
CLOSE ON: The dwarves raid Bilbo's pantry. CHEESE, MEAT,
WINE, VEGGIES, FRUITS; every food under the sun. And they
are all wrenched from the PANTRY SHELVES.
17 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - NIGHT 17
WIDE ON: Bilbo steps into the hall, seeing the dwarves cross
from pantry to dining room and back again. He steps forward.
[Bilbo:]
Excuse me, that's my chicken! Oh,
not my wine! Put that back! Put
that back!
ANGLE ON: Gloin and Fili pass Bilbo. Gloin carries THREE
WHEELS OF CHEESE.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
That's a tad excessive, don't you
think? Do you have a cheese knife?
[Fili:]
Cheese knife? He eats it by the
block.
Bilbo turns his attention to Oin, who carries WOODEN CHAIRS
at his side.
[Bilbo:]
No, that's Grandpa Mungo's chair!
Oin holds up a METAL TRUMPET to his ear.
[Oin:]
I can't hear what you're saying,
laddie.
He manages to wrangle free of Bilbo and enters the dining
room.
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 12.
18 INT. DINING ROOM - BAG END - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 18
Oin neatly sets the chairs down beside Gandalf. The wizard
helps the others set the table. Balin approaches the wizard,
carrying a TEA TRAY.
[Balin:]
Excuse me, Gandalf, may I tempt you
with a cup of chamomile tea?
[Gandalf:]
Oh, no thank you, Balin. A little
red wine for me, I think.
With a nod, Balin walks off. Gandalf exits the dining room,
ducking so as to not hit the doorway.
19 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 19
CLOSE ON: Gandalf walks into the central hub of the hallway.
He looks down, and starts to count the dwarves on his hands
as they pass by.
[Gandalf:]
Fili, Kili, Oin, Gloin, Balin and
Dwalin. We appear to be one dwarf
short.
Dwalin lounges in a near corner.
[Dwalin:]
He is late, is all. He travelled
North to a meeting of our kin. He
will come.
Balin approaches Gandalf, GLASS OF WINE in hand.
[Balin:]
As you requested, a glass of red
wine. It's got a fruity bouquet.
[Gandalf:]
Cheers!
Gandalf gulps down the lush, red wine.
20 INT. DINING ROOM - BAG END - NIGHT 20
ANGLE ON: All the dwarves are seated around Bilbo's dining
room table. They are messy about preparing and eating their
food.
Gandalf sits in the middle of the chaos, calm and collected.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 13.
20 CONTINUED: 20
CLOSE ON: Fili sits at the end of the table. He grabs a LOAF
OF BREAD from out of a basket.
[Fili:]
Gloin! Catch!
He throws the bread across the table, towards Gloin.
ANGLE ON: Gloin CATCHES IT IN HIS MOUTH. The dwarves APPLAUD
UPROARIOUSLY.
21 INT. PANTRY - BAG END - NIGHT 21
CLOSE ON: Bilbo watches the dwarves feast. It is clear that
he is disgusted. Quickly, he turns to face the pantry.
WIDE ON: It is completely cleared of food.
22 INT. KITCHEN - BAG END - NIGHT 22
ANGLE ON: Kili enters the kitchen, using a DOILY to wipe his
face. Bilbo comes in behind him and rips the doily out of
Kili's hands.
[Bilbo:]
Excuse me, that is a doily, not a
dishcloth.
Fili lounges against the near fireplace.
[Fili:]
But it's full of holes.
[Bilbo:]
It's supposed to look like that,
it's crochet.
[Fili:]
Oh, and a wonderful game it is too,
if you've got the balls for it.
Kili LAUGHS at his brother's jest. Bilbo throws the doily
down onto the table, infuriated.
[Bilbo:]
Bebother and confusticate these
dwarves!
Gandalf enters the kitchen, concerned.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 14.
22 CONTINUED: 22
[Gandalf:]
My dear Bilbo, what on earth is the
matter?
[Bilbo:]
What's the matter? I'm surrounded
by dwarves! What are they doing
here?
Kili hoists a CHAIN OF SAUSAGES over his shoulder. Fili
grabs one end, trying to take them from him. Gandalf
observes the scuffle, amused.
[Gandalf:]
They're quite a merry gathering,
once you get used to them.
[Bilbo:]
I don't want to get used to them!
Bilbo leads Gandalf into the hallway.
23 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 23
Bilbo points to a MUD SPLATTERED RUG.
[Bilbo:]
There's mud trod into the carpet,
they've pillaged the pantry! I'm
not even going to tell you what
they've done in the bathroom;
they've all but destroyed the
plumbing! I don't understand what
they're doing in my house!
Balin approaches the pair, tapping Bilbo on the shoulder.
[Balin:]
Sorry, I hate to interrupt, but
where would you like me to put my
plate.
Fili enters the hallway.
[Fili:]
Here you go, Balin, give it to me.
Fili takes the PLATE, quickly turning and throwing it to
Kili, standing at the doorway. Kili throws the dish into the
kitchen, where -
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 15.
24 INT. KITCHEN - BAG END - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 24
CLOSE ON: Oin stands beside the SINK, catching all of the
plates and putting them neatly into the sink.
25 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - NIGHT 25
Bilbo watches as the dish throwing cycle continues.
[Bilbo:]
Excuse me, that's my mother's West
Farthing crokery, it's over a
hundred years old!
ANGLE ON: The dwarves ignore him, and continue to throw the
plates about. Bilbo hears BEATING and SCRAPING from the
dining room. He goes to investigate.
26 INT. DINING ROOM - BAG END - NIGHT 26
CLOSE ON: Dwalin and Gloin sit at the table, rhythmically
DRUMMING on the table with their UTENSILS.
[Bilbo:]
Could you please not do that?
You'll blunt them!
[Gloin:]
You hear that, lads? He says we'll
blunt the knives.
27 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 27
ANGLE ON: Fili and Kili continue to throw the dishes around,
singing to the beat of the BANGING UTENSILS.
[Kili:]
(singing)
Blunt the knives, bend the forks!
[Fili:]
(singing)
Smash the bottles and burn the
corks!
[All Dwarves:]
(singing)
Smash the bottles and crack the
plates! That's what Bilbo Baggins
hates!
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 16.
28 INT. BAG END - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 28
The dwarves continue to throw the dishes from the dining
room, to the hallway, to the kitchen and back to the dining
room, singing all the while
[All Dwarves:]
(singing)
Cut the cloth, tread on fat! Leave
the bones on the bedroom mat! Pour
the milk on the pantry floor,
splash the wine on every door! Dump
the crocks in a boiling bowl, pound
them up with a thumping pole! When
you're finished, if they are whole,
send them down the hall to roll!
That's what Bilbo Baggins hates!
Bilbo rushes around his house, frantic and panicked.
29 INT. DINING ROOM - BAG END - NIGHT 29
CLOSE ON: Bilbo sprints into the dining room.
ANGLE ON: Gandalf and the dwarves are circled around the
table, LAUGHING. All of the dishes are stacked neatly on the
table, SPARKLY CLEAN. Bilbo is relieved.
Suddenly, there is a LOUD KNOCK at the door. Everyone goes
quiet.
[Gandalf:]
He is here.
30 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - NIGHT 30
ANGLE ON: The door opens. There, standing on the doorstep,
is the noble looking THORIN OAKENSHIELD.
[Thorin:]
Gandalf, I thought you said this
place would be easy to find. I lost
my way, twice. I wouldn't have
found it at all had it not been for
that mark on the door.
WIDE ON: Gandalf shuts the door behind Thorin. All the
dwarves bow at his presence. Bilbo pushes through the crowd,
entering the hall.
[Bilbo:]
Mark? There's no mark on that door,
it was pained a week ago.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 17.
30 CONTINUED: 30
[Gandalf:]
There is a mark; I put it there
myself. Bilbo Baggins, allow me to
introduce the leader of our
company, Thorin Oakenshield.
ANGLE ON: Thorin steps towards Bilbo. There is STARK
JUDGEMENT in his eyes.
[Thorin:]
So, this is the hobbit. Tell me,
Mr. Baggins, have you done much
fighting?
[Bilbo:]
Pardon me?
[Thorin:]
Axe or sword? What is your weapon
of choice?
[Bilbo:]
Well, I do have some skill at
Conkers, if you must know, but I
fail to see why that's relevant.
[Thorin:]
Thought as much. He looks more like
a grocer than a burglar.
The dwarves LAUGH at Thorin's jest. He gives them a warm
smile and walks himself down the hall.
31 INT. DINING ROOM - BAG END - NIGHT 31
The dwarves sit around the table with Thorin, who picks at
some SOUP. Gandalf sits beside him, smoking a pipe. Bilbo
watches from the doorway.
[Balin:]
What news from the meeting in Ered
Luin? Did they all come?
[Thorin:]
Aye. Envoys from all seven
kingdoms.
The dwarves MURMUR IN EXCITEMENT.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 18.
31 CONTINUED: 31
[Dwalin:]
What did the dwarves of the Iron
Hills say? Is Dain with us?
CLOSE ON: Thorin hesitates, frowning. All eyes are on him.
[Thorin:]
They will not come.
ANGLE ON: The dwarves GASP and EXCLAIM in disappointment.
[Thorin:] (CONT'D)
They say this quest is ours and
ours alone.
[Bilbo:]
You're going on a quest?
Bilbo looks to the dwarves, confused. Gandalf taps him on
the shoulder.
[Gandalf:]
Bilbo, my dear fellow, let us have
a little more light.
Bilbo leaves the room and comes back with a CANDLE. He sets
it down near Gandalf, who has pulled out A MAP and is
spreading it across the table.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
Far to the east, over ranges and
rivers, beyond woodlands and
wastelands, lies a single solitary
peak.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf points to a peak drawn on the map. THE
LONELY MOUNTAIN.
[Bilbo:]
The Lonely Mountain?
ANGLE ON: Bilbo peers down at the map.
CLOSE ON: He notices a RED DRAGON drawn beside the mountain.
[Gloin:]
Aye! Oin has read the portents and
the portents say it is time.
ANGLE ON: The other dwarves GROAN. They have heard this all
before.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 19.
31 CONTINUED: (2) 31
[Oin:]
Ravens have been seen flying back
to the mountain as it was foretold:
when the birds of yore return to
Erebor, the reign of the beast will
end.
Bilbo looks up from the map, concerned.
[Bilbo:]
What beast?
[Fili:]
Well, that would be a reference to
Smaug the Terrible, chiefest and
greatest calamity of our age.
Airborne fire-breather, teeth like
razors, claws like meathooks.
Extremely fond of precious metals.
[Bilbo:]
Yes, I know what a dragon is.
[Balin:]
The task to win back the mountain
would be difficult enough with an
army behind us. But we number just
seven, and not seven of the best.
The dwarves object to this insult, SHOUTING RETORTS AND
PROTESTS.
[Gloin:]
We may be few in numbers, but we're
fighters. All of us, to the last
dwarf.
[Kili:]
And you forget, we have a wizard in
our company. Gandalf must have
killed hundreds of dragons in his
time.
[Gandalf:]
Well, no, I wouldn't say that I -
[Fili:]
How many then?
[Gandalf:]
What?

[Fili:]
How many dragons have you killed?
Go on, give us a number!
CLOSE ON: An embarrassed Gandalf starts to COUGH on his pipe
smoke. The dwarves GROAN, hopeless.
ANGLE ON: Thorin rises to his feet.
[Thorin:]
If we have read these signs, do you
not think others will have read
them too? Rumours have begun to
spread. The dragon Smaug has not
been seen for sixty years. Eyes
look east to the mountain,
assessing, wondering, weighing the
risk. Perhaps the vast wealth of
our people now lies unprotected. Do
we sit back as others claim what is
rightfully ours? Or do we seize
this chance to take back Erebor?
Inspired by the speech, the dwarves JUMP AND CHEER. Balin
gets to his feet and RAISES HIS VOICE.
[Balin:]
You forget, the front gate is
sealed! There is no way into the
mountain.
[Gandalf:]
That, my dear Balin, is not
entirely true.
CLOSE ON: With a twiddle of his fingers, Gandalf produces a
DWARVISH KEY, ornately wrought. Thorin looks at it in
wonder.
[Thorin:]
How came you by this?
[Gandalf:]
It was given to me by your father,
by Thrain, for safe keeping. It is
yours now.
ANGLE ON: Gandalf hands the key to Thorin. Everyone looks on
in a proud astonishment.

31 CONTINUED: (4) 31
[Kili:]
If there is a key, there must be a
door.
[Gandalf:]
These ruins speak of another
passage into the lower halls.
The wizard points to RUNES on the map.
[Fili:]
There's another way in.
[Gandalf:]
Well, if we can find it, but dwarf
doors are invisible when closed.
The answer lies hidden somewhere in
this map and I do not have the
skill to find it. But there are
others in Middle Earth who can.
The dwarves look to him, listening carefully.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
The task I have in mind will
require a great deal of stealth,
and no small amount of courage.
But, if we are careful and clever,
I believe that it can be done.
[Oin:]
That's why we need a burglar.
[Bilbo:]
A good one too. An expert, I'd
imagine.
[Gloin:]
And are you?
Bilbo freezes, half confused, half afraid.
[Bilbo:]
Am I what?
[Oin:]
He said he's an expert!
CLOSE ON: Several dwarves CHUCKLE WITH JOY. Bilbo's face is
livid with shock.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 22.
31 CONTINUED: (5) 31
[Bilbo:]
Me? No, no, no, I'm not a burglar.
I've never stolen a thing in my
life.
[Balin:]
I'm afraid I have to agree with Mr.
Baggins. He's hardly burglar
material.
[Dwalin:]
Aye, the wild is no place for
gentlefolk who can neither fight
nor fend for themselves.
Bilbo nods in desperate agreement, ignoring the insult.
Gandalf shakes his head, irritated.
[Gandalf:]
Hobbits are remarkably light on
their feet! In fact, they can go
unseen by most if they choose. And
while the dragon is accustomed to
the smell of dwarf, the scent of a
hobbit is all but unknown to him
which gives us a distinct
advantage.
ANGLE ON: Gandalf turns to Thorin, determined to make his
point.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
You asked me to find the eighth
member of this company and I have
chosen Mr. Baggins. There's a lot
more to him than appearances
suggest, and he's got a great deal
to offer than any of you know,
including himself. You must trust
me on this.
Thorin SIGHS. He scans the room, weighing the outcome.
[Thorin:]
Very well, we'll do it your way.
(turns to Balin)
Give him our contract.
Balin hands a SCROLLED CONTRACT to Bilbo.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 23.
31 CONTINUED: (6) 31
[Balin:]
It's just the usual summary of out
of pocket expenses, time required,
remuneration, funeral arrangements
and so forth.
[Bilbo:]
Funeral arrangements?
Bilbo takes the contract reluctantly. He unrolls the scroll,
which nearly reaches the floor.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
Terms: cash on delivery, up to, but
not exceeding one eighth of total
profit, if any. Present company
shall not be liable for injuries
inflicted by or sustained as a
consequence thereof, including, but
not limited to - lacerations?
Evisceration? Incineration?
[Fili:]
Oh, he'll melt the flesh off your
bones in the blink of an eye.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo seems breathless. He drops the contract to
his side, holding a hand to his chest.
[Balin:]
You alright, laddie?
[Bilbo:]
Yes, but I feel a bit faint.
[Fili:]
Think furnace with wings. Flash of
light, searing pain, then - POOF!
You're nothing more than a pile of
ash!
Bilbo starts PANTING, trying to compose himself as the
others look on. Finally, Bilbo rises, turning to Balin.
[Bilbo:]
Nope.
ANGLE ON: He FAINTS onto the floor. Gandalf shakes his head,
glaring at Fili.

THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 24.

[Gandalf:]
Very helpful, Fili.
32 INT. SITTING ROOM - BAG END - NIGHT 32
Bilbo sits at his chair, shivering and clutching a MUG.
[Bilbo:]
I'll be alright, just let me sit
quietly for a moment.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf gazes down at him, a look of
disappointment in his eyes.
[Gandalf:]
You've been sitting quietly for far
too long. When did doliles and your
mother's dishes become so important
to you? I remember a young hobbit
who was always running off in
search of elves in the woods. He'd
stay out late, trailing mud and
twigs and fireflies. A young hobbit
who would have liked nothing better
than to find out what was beyond
the borders of the Shire.
(beat)
The world is not in your books and
maps. It's out there.
ANGLE ON: He points to the window in the room. It gleams in
the PEARLY MOONLIGHT.
[Bilbo:]
I can't just go running off into
the blue! I am a Baggins of Bag
End!
[Gandalf:]
You are also a Took! Did you know
that your great-great-great-great
uncle, Bullroarer Took was so large
he could ride a real horse?
[Bilbo:]
Yes.
[Gandalf:]
Well, he could! In the Battle of
Green Fields, he charged the goblin

[Gandalf:] (cont'd)
ranks. He swung his club so hard,
it knocked the Goblin King's head
clean off, and it sailed a hundred
yards through the air and went down
a rabbit hole. And thus the battle
was won, and the game of golf
invented at the same time.
[Bilbo:]
I do believe you made that up.
Gandalf sits himself across from Bilbo.
[Gandalf:]
Well, all good stories deserve
embellishment. You'll have a tale
or two to tell of your own when you
come back.
[Bilbo:]
Can you promise that I will come
back?
[Gandalf:]
No. But if you do, you will not be
the same.
[Bilbo:]
That's what I thought. I'm sorry,
Gandalf, but I can't sign this.
You've got the wrong hobbit.
Bilbo leaves the contract on the mantle and exits the
sitting room. Gandalf watches him leave, disappointed.
33 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - NIGHT 33
CLOSE ON: Thorin and Balin stand in the hallway, watching
Bilbo enter his bedroom. Balin SIGHS.
[Balin:]
It appears we have lost our
burglar. Probably for the best. The
odds were always against us. After
all, what are we? Merchants,
miners, tinkers, toy-makers; hardly
the stuff of legend.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 26.
33 CONTINUED: 33
[Thorin:]
There are a few warriors amongst
us.
[Balin:]
Old warriors.
[Thorin:]
I will take each and every one of
these dwarves over an army from the
Iron Hills. For when I called upon
them, they came. Loyalty, honor, a
willing heart; I can ask no more
than that.
[Balin:]
You don't have to do this. You have
a choice. You've done honorably by
our people. You have built us a new
life for us in the Blue Mountains,
a life of peace and plenty. A life
that is worth more than all the
gold in Erebor.
Thorin withdraws the Dwarvish key from his pocket. He holds
it before Balin for him to see.
[Thorin:]
From my grandfather to my father,
this has come to me. They dreamt of
the day when the dwarves of Erebor
would reclaim their homeland. There
is no choice, Balin. Not for me.
[Balin:]
Then we are with you, laddie. We'll
see it done.
With a DEEP SIGH, Balin places a supportive hand on Thorin's
shoulder.
34 INT. SITTING ROOM - BAG END - NIGHT 34
WIDE ON: All seven dwarves sit around the fire in the dark
sitting room. They HUM A SOMBER TUNE. Smoking his pipe near
the mantle, Thorin begins to SING.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 27.
34 CONTINUED: 34
[Thorin:]
(singing)
Far over the Misty Mountain cold,
to dungeons deep and caverns old,
we must away ere break of day to
find our long forgotten gold.
The rest of the dwarves rise from their seats, joining in
with Thorin.
[All Dwarves:]
(singing)
The pines were roaring on the
height, the winds were moaning in
the night, the fire was red, its
flaming spread, the trees like
torches blazed with light.
Gandalf stands near the window, staring out and listening to
the song.
35 INT. BEDROOM - BAG END - NIGHT 35
ANGLE ON: Bilbo sits on the edge of his bed, listening to
the dwarves sing. He stares into his fire, watching the
smoke slowly rise.
36 EXT. BAG END - HOBBITON - NIGHT 36
WIDE ON: EMBERS FLUTTER out of Bilbo's chimney and into the
starry night sky.
37 INT. BEDROOM - BAG END - DAY 37
The morning light streams into Bilbo's bedroom.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo wakes, squinting at the sunlight. Suddenly,
he notices how quiet the house is.
38 INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - DAY 38
ANGLE ON: Bilbo sneaks around the hallway, peering into all
of the doorways. They are all empty.
[Bilbo:]
Hello?
He discovers that the mess of the party has been cleaned,
almost as if it never happened.
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 28.
39 INT. SITTING ROOM - BAG END - DAY 39
Victorious, Bilbo waltzes into the sitting room. He gazes at
the tidiness of the room, smiling. Slowly, his joy deflates,
leaving him almost defeated.
He wanders deeper into the room, stopping next to a table.
The contract lies there, unsigned. Bilbo stares long and
hard at it, thinking.
Suddenly, he looks up, determined.
40 EXT. HOBBITON - DAY 40
CRANE SHOT: Bilbo darts out of his home and down the hill. A
TRAVELING PACK is strapped to his back, the contract
flapping in the wind behind him.
ANGLE ON: He jumps over fences, animals and crops. He
sprints past BEFUDDLED NEIGHBORS who shake their heads in
disapproval.
WIDE ON: Finally, Bilbo passes the last round of houses.
There, Master Worrywort stands at his fence. He sees Bilbo
and gives him a SIDEWAYS LOOK.
[Worrywort:]
Mr. Bilbo, where are you off to?
[Bilbo:]
Can't stop, I'm already late!
[Worrywort:]
Late for what?
[Bilbo:]
I'm going on an adventure!
With a grin, Bilbo leaves his home behind him and rushes
into the world ahead.
41 EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF HOBBITON - DAY 41
The Company is trotting down a dirt road, leaving the Shire.
The dwarves are mounted on PONIES, their luggage tied behind
them. As they ride, most exchange SOUR WORDS about Bilbo.
[Bilbo:]
Wait!
CLOSE ON: Bilbo rushes down the road after them.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 29.
41 CONTINUED: 41
ANGLE ON: Gandalf and the dwarves stop their horses and turn
to see Bilbo. He waves the contract above his head,
grinning.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
I signed it!
He hands the contract over to Balin, who inspects it with a
pair of EYEGLASSES.
[Balin:]
Everything appears to be in order.
Welcome, Master Baggins, to the
company of Thorin Oakenshield.
The dwarves give INDIFFERENT APPLAUSE.
CLOSE ON: Thorin looks thoroughly unimpressed.
[Thorin:]
Give him a pony.
[Bilbo:]
No, no, that won't be necessary,
I'm sure I can keep up on foot.
I've done my fair share of walking
holidays, you know. I even got as
far as Frogmorton once.
Two dwarves ride alongside Bilbo and hoist him upwards.
42 EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF HOBBITON - DAY - LATER 42
ANGLE ON: Bilbo rides his pony, glaring down at the animal
and shriveling up his nose.
Suddenly, Bilbo SNEEZES LOUDLY.
[Bilbo:]
Oh, all this horse hair. I'm having
a reaction.
He searches in his pocket for something. Unable to find it,
he looks up in panic.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
Wait! Wait! Stop! We have to turn
around.
WIDE ON: The entire company comes to a halt.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 30.
42 CONTINUED: 42
[Gandalf:]
My dear Bilbo, what on earth is the
matter?
[Bilbo:]
I forgot my handkerchief!
ANGLE ON: From the front of the line, Fili tears a STRIP OF
CLOTH from his shirt. He tosses it to Bilbo.
[Fili:]
Here, use this!
Bilbo catches the rag and looks at it in disgust.
[Thorin:]
Move on!
The dwarves LAUGH, resuming their journey.
43 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - ERIADOR - DAY 43
CRANE SHOT: The Company travels through VAST, ROLLING HILLS
and PLAINS. Forests are visible in the distance, darkness
creeping between the trees.
[Gandalf:] (V.O.)
You'll have to manage without
pocket-handkerchiefs and a good
many other things, Bilbo Baggins,
before we reach our journey's end.
You were born to the rolling hills
and little rivers of the Shire, but
home is now behind you; the world
is ahead.
Now, the company treks up a MOUNTAINSIDE, which looms over
the flat plains below. The sun sets behind them.
44 EXT. FOREST - ERIADOR - DAY 44
CLOSE ON: RAIN THUNDERS DOWN on the Company. Every one of
them seems cold, wet and miserable.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo rides beside Gandalf, who seems unaffected
by this downpour.
[Gloin:]
Gandalf, can't you do something
about his deluge?
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 31.
44 CONTINUED: 44
[Gandalf:]
It is raining, Master Dwarf, and it
will continue to rain until the
rain is done. If you wish to change
the weather of the world, you
should find yourself another
wizard.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo looks curious.
[Bilbo:]
Are there any?
[Gandalf:]
What?
[Bilbo:]
Other wizards?
[Gandalf:]
There are five of us. The greatest
of our order is Saruman the White.
Then there are the two blue
wizards.
(beat)
You know, I've quite forgotten
their names.
[Bilbo:]
And who is the fifth?
[Gandalf:]
Well, that would be Radagast the
Brown.
[Bilbo:]
Is he a great wizard or is he more
like you?
Gandalf is slightly offended.
[Gandalf:]
I think he is a very great wizard
in his own way. He's a gently soul
who prefers the company of animals
to others.
45 EXT. RHOSGOBEL - MIRKWOOD - DAY 45
WIDE ON: We PAN DOWN from the treetops of Mirkwood.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 32.
45 CONTINUED: 45
[Gandalf:] (V.O.)
He keeps a watchful eye to the vast
forest lands to the east, and a
good thing too, for always evil
will look to find a foothold in
this world.
Sunlight streams down onto the forest floor. A figure runs
through the forest, clutching a STAFF for support. RADAGAST
THE BROWN.
CLOSE ON: Radagast comes across a DYING PLANT, as black as
the night sky.
[Radagast:]
Not good! Not good at all!
ANGLE ON: Radagast darts towards his house. Many DEAD PLANTS
and ANIMAL litter the ground. He inspects the plants nearby,
MUSHROOMS, TREES and all.
He steps back from his work, distressed. Radagast gives a
WHISTLE, and a FLOCK OF BIRDS, come sailing down.
Radagast takes off his HAT, revealing a SMALL BIRD NEST on
his head. The birds clamber in and Radagast puts his hat
back on.
CLOSE ON: Something on the ground catches the wizard's eye.
GASPING, he rushes forward and picks it up. It is a
HEDGEHOG. Radagast cradles the dying creature, weeping.
[Radagast:] (CONT'D)
Sebastian! Good gracious!
ANGLE ON: Radagast takes off running towards an OVERGROWN
HOUSE.
46 INT. RHOSGOBEL - MIRKWOOD - DAY 46
Urgent, Radagast places Sebastian on the counter. He riffles
through this cabients, trying to cure the hedgehog with
VARIOUS TECHNIQUES. None work.
CLOSE ON: As he searches for remedies, MORE HEDGEHOGS
surround Sebastion, curious.
[Radagast:]
Move back! Give him some air, for
goodness sake!
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 33.
46 CONTINUED: 46
The wizard continues his treatments, each one becoming more
desperate than the last. He steps back in frustration.
[Radagast:] (CONT'D)
I don't understand why it's not
working! It's not as if it's
witchcraft!
Suddenly, his face falls. Gravely serious, Radagast looks
down at Sebastian.
[Radagast:] (CONT'D)
Witchcraft. But it is; a dark and
powerful magic.
SCURRYING NOISES sound from outside.
ANGLE ON: Radagast looks, seeing the SHADOWS of several
GIANT SPIDERS crawling up the house. Panicked, Radagast bars
his door.
CLOSE ON: Sebastian CROAKS from the counter, GASPING for
air. Suddenly, he seizes up, dead. TEARS WELL in Radagast's
eyes.
The house begins to CREAK. The spiders are climbing onto the
roof.
ANGLE ON: Radagast turns to his staff and pulls out a BLUE
STONE from its top. He grabs Sebastian from the counter and
leans against a TREE TRUNK.
He begins to WHISPER A SPELL, holding the blue stone to
Sebastian's snout.
As Radagast chants, spiders begin to break the roof above.
PATCHES OF SUNLIGHT dot the floor as RUBBLE of the shattered
roof crumbles downward.
CLOSE ON: Radagast continues to chant, almost in a
TRANCE-LIKE STATE. As the spell grows more and more
powerful, a DARKNESS seems to fall over the house. A BLACK,
INKY SUBSTANCE begins to fill the blue stone, until -
ANGLE ON: Sebastian GASPS for air, alive. Radagast smiles
down at the creature as the darkness fades from the house.
From above, it sounds as if the spiders are crawling back
down the house.
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 34.
47 EXT. RHOSGOBEL - MIRKWOOD - DAY 47
Radagast runs outside. He catches a glimpse of a GIANT
SPIDER crawling off into the forest.
[Radagast:]
Where in this good earth did those
foul creatures come from?
A BIRD flies in beside him, TWITTERING. Radagast listens
intently, understanding the animal.
[Radagast:] (CONT'D)
The old fortress? Show me.
48 EXT. MIRKWOOD - DAY 48
A WOODEN SLEIGH bursts through the trees, pulled by SEVERAL
LARGE RABBITS. Radagast stands on the sleigh, holding onto
railings as he darts down the forest track.
WIDE ON: In the distance, an OLD, RUINED FORTRESS towers
above the trees. DOL GULDUR.
49 EXT. ABANDONED FARMHOUSE - TROLLSHAWS - DAY 49
WIDE ON: The Company approaches a RUINED FARMHOUSE. Thorin
scans the area, before turning to the others.
[Thorin:]
We'll camp here for the night.
Fili, Kili, look after the ponies.
Make sure you stay with them.
The group begins to dismount.
ANGLE ON: Gandalf wanders into the farmhouse, examining the
ruin.
[Gandalf:]
A farmer and his family used to
live here.
From outside, Thorin turns to Oin and Gloin.
[Thorin:]
Oin, Gloin, get a fire going.
[Gloin:]
Right you are.
Gloin nods in agreement, leading his brother into the woods.
Gandalf locks eyes with Thorin as he enters the farmhouse.

THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 35.
49 CONTINUED: 49
[Gandalf:]
I think it would be wiser to move
on. We could make for the Hidden
Valley.
[Thorin:]
I have told you already, I will not
go near that place.
[Gandalf:]
Why not? The elves could help us!
We could get food, rest, advice.
[Thorin:]
I do not need their advice.
[Gandalf:]
We have a map we cannot read; Lord
Elrond will help us.
[Thorin:]
Help? A dragon attacks Erebor, what
help came from the elves? Orcs
plunder Moria, desecrate our sacred
halls, and the elves looked on and
did nothing. You ask me to seek out
the very people who betrayed my
grandfather and betrayed my father?
[Gandalf:]
You are neither of them. And
besides, it was not Lord Elrond who
abandoned you at Erebor. That blame
lies with King Thranduil of the
Woodland Realm. I did not give you
that map and key for you to hold
onto the past.
[Thorin:]
I did not know they were yours to
keep.
Gandalf scowls at Thorin and stops away. He passes Bilbo,
tending to the horses. Bilbo seems confused.
[Bilbo:]
Everything all right? Gandalf,
where are you going?
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 36.
49 CONTINUED: (2) 49
[Gandalf:]
To seek the company of the only one
around here who's got any sense.
[Bilbo:]
And who's that?
[Gandalf:]
Myself, Mr. Baggins! I've had
enough of dwarves for one day.
Thorin steps out of the farmhouse, glowering after Gandalf.
[Thorin:]
Come on, Dwalin, we're hungry.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo turns to Balin.
[Bilbo:]
Is he coming back?
Balin looks uncertain.
50 EXT. ABANDONED FARMHOUSE - TROLLSHAWS - NIGHT 50
CLOSE ON: Dwalin stands near the fire, POURING SOUP into TWO
BOWLS. Bilbo is on lookout, visibly worried.
[Bilbo:]
He's been a long time.
[Dwalin:]
Who?
[Bilbo:]
Gandalf!
[Dwalin:]
He's a wizard, he does as he
chooses.
(hands Bilbo the bowls)
Here, do us a favor: take these to
the lads.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo carefully takes the bowls and makes for the
forest.
51 EXT. WOODS - TROLLSHAWS - NIGHT 51
CLOSE ON: Bilbo enters the forest where Fili and Kili watch
over the ponies. They stare out into the darkness, ALMOST

PETRIFIED.
[Bilbo:]
What's the matter?
[Kili:]
We're supposed to be looking after
the ponies.
[Fili:]
Only, we've encountered a slight
problem.
[Kili:]
We had sixteen. Now there's
fourteen.
ANGLE ON: The PONIES mill about in their pens. Two are
missing.
52 EXT. WOODS - TROLLSHAWS - NIGHT - LATER 52
WIDE ON: Fili and Kili examine the horses in their pens.
Bilbo follows behind them, clutching the wooden bowls.
[Kili:]
Daisy and Bungo are missing.
[Bilbo:]
Well, that's not good. That is not
good at all. Shouldn't we tell
Thorin?
[Fili:]
No, let's not worry him. As our
official burglar, we thought that
you might like to look into it.
Bilbo looks around, seeing several UPROOTED TREES.
[Bilbo:]
Well, something big uprooted these
trees.
[Fili:]
That was our thinking.
[Bilbo:]
Something very big and possibly
quite dangerous.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 38.
52 CONTINUED: 52
ANGLE ON: Suddenly, Fili crouches behind one of the uprooted
trees. He points deeper into the woods.
[Fili:]
(whispering)
Hey, there's a light.
Fili beckons the other two forward.
[Fili:] (CONT'D)
Over here. Stay down.
The three rush forward and take cover behind a LOG, spying
on the FLICKERING LIGHT.
HARSH LAUGHTER sounds from near the fire.
[Bilbo:]
What is it?
[Kili:]
Trolls.
Fili and Kili run closer to the fire. Bilbo runs after them,
still gripping onto their meals.
THUNDER FOOTSTEPS come from nearby. Quickly, the trio takes
cover behind an aging oak tree.
They are all alarmed to see a massive Mountain Troll,
[William:], walk towards the fire. He holds TWO MORE PONIES at
his side.
[Bilbo:]
(whispering)
He's got Myrtle and Minty! I think
they're going to eat them, we have
to do something.
[Fili:]
Yes, you should. Mountain trolls
are slow and stupid, and you're so
small.
[Bilbo:]

It's perfectly safe; we'll be right
behind you.

Fili pushes Bilbo forward, taking the bowls from him.
[Kili:]
If you run into trouble, hoot twice
like a barn owl, once like a brown
owl.
Bilbo walks forward in reluctance.
[Bilbo:]
Twice like a barn owl, once like a
brown owl? Are you sure this is a
good idea?
WIDE ON: He turns around, but Fili and Kili are already out
of site. With a SIGH, Bilbo trudges forward.
53 EXT. TROLL LAIR - TROLLSHAWS - NIGHT 53
Two trolls, BERT and TOM sit around a fire. Bert STIRS the
contents of a CAULDRON dangling above the flames. Tom
watches him with a hungry stare.
William enters the lair. He carries the two ponies into a
makeshift pen, locking them inside.
[Bert:]
Mutton yesterday, mutton today and
blimey, if it don't look like
mutton again tomorrow.
[William:]
Quite your gripping. These ain't
sheep; these is West Nags!
[Tom:]
I don't like horse, I never have.
Not enough fat on them.
[Bert:]
Well, it's better than that
leathery old farmer. All skin and
bones, he was. I'm still picking
bits of him out of me teeth.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo sneaks around the campsite, hiding behind
trees and bushes.
WIDE ON: William sits himself beside the fire. Suddenly, Tom
SNEEZES into the cauldron.

THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 40.

[Bert:]
Oh, that's lovely, that is: a
floater!
[William:]
Might improve the flavor!
[Tom:]
There's more where that came from!
Tom begins to sneeze again, but Bert grabs him by the nose.
Bert forces Tom down.
[Bert:]
Sit down!
ANGLE ON: Bilbo takes advantage of this scuffle, and dashes
towards the pens.
WIDE ON: WHIMPERING, Tom pulls out his HANDKERCHIEF and
blows.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo turns and sees that the troll is wearing a
LONG KNIFE in his belt. The hobbit creeps forward, eyes set
on the blade.
[William:]
I'm starving! Are we having horse
tonight or what?
[Bert:]
Shut your cakehole. You'll eat what
I give you!
[William:]
How come he's the cook? Everything
tastes the same; everything tastes
like chicken.
[Tom:]
Except the chicken.
[William:]
That tastes like fish!
WIDE ON: Bert turns to his brew, taking a sip.
[Bert:]
Oh, that is beautifully balanced,
that is!

Bert passes the ladle to Tom, who puts his handkerchief back
over the knife.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo stands behind the troll. He carefully
reaches for the knife.
[William:]
Me guts are grumbling. I've got to
snaffle something. Flesh! I need
flesh!
Bilbo's fingers brush against Tom's knife - so close!
Suddenly, Tom reaches for his handkerchief. Instead, the
troll grabs Bilbo, SPRAYING SNOT all over him. Tom peers
down at the hobbit, taken aback.
[Tom:]
Blimey! Bert, look what's come out
of me hooter! It's got arms and
legs and everything.
The other trolls gather around, staring at Bilbo in
amazement.
[William:]
What is it?
[Tom:]
I don't know, but I don't like the
way it wriggles around.
Tom shakes Bilbo to the ground. Slowly, he gets back on his
feet. William stands above Bilbo, pointing a JAGGED ROCK
down at him.
[William:]
What are you then, an oversized
squirrel?
[Bilbo:]
I'm a burgl- a hobbit!
[Tom:]
A Burgla-Hobbit?
[William:]
Can we cook him?
[Tom:]
We can try!
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 42.
53 CONTINUED: (3) 53
WIDE ON: Tom tries to grab Bilbo, but he dodges. Bilbo
sprints toward the trees. Toward an escape. However, Bert
corners him.
[Bert:]
He wouldn't make more than a
mouthful, not when he's skinned and
boned!
[William:]
Perhaps there's more Burgla-Hobbits
around these parts. Might be enough
for a pie!
All of the trolls try to grab Bilbo, but he outruns them at
every turn.
[Tom:]
It's too quick!
Bilbo runs through Tom's leg as Bert swings his ladle,
aiming for Bilbo. He hits Tom's knee instead, making the
troll YELP out in pain.
ANGLE ON: Finally, William grabs a hold of Bilbo, and
dangles him upside down.
[William:]
Are there any more of you little
fellows hiding where you shouldn't?
[Bilbo:]
No.
[Tom:]
He's lying.
[Bilbo:]
No, I'm not!
[Tom:]
Hang his toes over the fire! Make
him squeal!
Kili emerges from out of the bushes. He hacks Tom's leg,
sending the troll SQUEALING. The other trolls look down at
Kili, startled.
[Kili:]
Drop him!
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 43.
53 CONTINUED: (4) 53
[William:]
You what?
[Kili:]
I said, drop him.
GROWLING, William throws Bilbo on top of Kili. The other
dwarves charge out of the treeline, weapons drawn.
Bravely, they fight against the trolls, HACKING and
HAMMERING. As the battle rages on, Bilbo creeps beneath the
trolls' feet, dodging every footfall.
Tom's knife falls from his belt as Fili and Kili hammer down
on his toes. Bilbo sneaks over, grabbing the weapon and
darting over to the pens.
Bilbo cuts the ponies free, sending them running in every
direction. From across the clearing, William sees him. The
troll lumbers over, grabbing Bilbo by his arms and legs.
Seeing Bilbo, the dwarves freeze in place.
[Fili:]
Bilbo!
[William:]
Lay down your arms, or we'll rip
his off!
Thorin looks up at Bilbo, conflicted. Finally, he throws his
sword onto the ground, almost in reluctance. The others
follow suit, dropping their swords and axes by their sides.
54 EXT. TROLL LAIR - TROLLSHAWS - NIGHT - LATER 54
William throws SEVERAL LOGS onto the fire. Dwalin, Fili, Oin
and Gloin have all been tied to a spit, GROANING and
PROTESTING. The others are tied up in sacks nearby.
Bert tends to the spit, spinning it back and forth. Tom
approaches him.
[Tom:]
Don't bother cooking them. Let's
just sit on them and squash them
into jelly.
[Bert:]
They should be sauteed and grilled
with a sprinkle of sage.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 44.
54 CONTINUED: 54
[Tom:]
Well, that does sound quite nice.
[William:]
Never mind the seasoning; we ain't
got all night! Dawn ain't far away
and I don't fancy being turned to
stone.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo's face LIGHTS UP. He has an idea.
[Bilbo:]
Wait! You are making a terrible
mistake!
[Gloin:]
You can't reason with them, they're
half-wits.
[Fili:]
Half-wits? What does that make us?
[Bilbo:]
(to the Trolls)
I meant with the seasoning.
WIDE ON: Although still tied up, Bilbo manages to jump to
his feet.
[Bert:]
What about the seasoning?
[Bilbo:]
Well, have you smelt them? You're
going to need something stronger
than sage before you plate this lot
up.
The dwarves YELL IN PROTEST.
[William:]
What do you know about cooking
dwarf?
[Bert:]
Shut up and let the
flurgaburburrhobbit talk.
[Bilbo:]
Yes, well, the secret to cooking
dwarf is -

Yes? Come on!
[Bilbo:]
It's -
[Bert:]
Tell us the secret.
[Bilbo:]
Yes, I'm telling you, the secret is
to skin them first!
The dwarves ROAR in their rage. A grin spreads over Bert's
face.
[Bert:]
Tom, get me filleting knife.
[William:]
What a load of rubbish! I've eaten
plenty with their skins on. Scruff
them, I say, boots and all.
ANGLE ON: Suddenly, Bilbo spots Gandalf slipping behind some
trees. The wizard appears on a LARGE ROCK above them. A
powerful rage seems to posses the wizard.
[Gandalf:]
The dawn will take you all!
CLOSE ON: Confused, the trolls turn to Gandalf.
[Bert:]
Who's that?
[William:]
No idea.
[Tom:]
Can we eat him too?
ANGLE ON: Gandalf strikes the rock beneath him with his
staff. It breaks in half with a CRACK. Sunlight pours into
the clearing.
The light touches the troll's skin, TURNING THEM INTO STONE
as they SCREAM AND HOWL. Within seconds, the trolls are
nothing more than STATUES.

GROANS from the spit.
[Dwalin:]
Oh, get your foot out of my back!
55 EXT. TROLL LAIR - TROLLSHAWS - DAY 55
WIDE ON: The dwarves help free one another from the sacks,
HEAVING as they push and pull.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf walks by one of the stone trolls and
THUMPS it's head with his staff, smiling. Thorin approaches
Gandalf.
[Thorin:]
Where did you go to, if I may ask?
[Gandalf:]
To look ahead.
[Thorin:]
What brought you back?
[Gandalf:]
Looking behind. Nasty business;
still, they're all in one piece.
[Thorin:]
No thanks to your burglar.
[Gandalf:]
He had the nous to play for time.
None of the rest of you thought of
that.
Thorin looks repentant. Gandalf turns, examining the trolls.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
They must have come down from the
Ettenmoors.
[Thorin:]
Since when do mountain trolls
venture this far south?
[Gandalf:]
Oh, not for an age. Not since a
darker power ruled these lands. In
any case, they could not have moved
in daylight.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 47.
55 CONTINUED: 55
[Thorin:]
There must be a cave nearby.
Thorin and Gandalf scan the surrounding area.
56 INT. TROLL HOARD - TROLLSHAWS - DAY 56
WIDE ON: Gandalf leads the Company down a DARK CAVE. As they
enter, the dwarves begin to COUGH AND RETCH at the smell.
[Kili:]
What's that stench?
[Gandalf:]
It's a troll hoard. Be careful what
you touch.
ANGLE ON: The Company finds PILES OF GOLD COINS and OTHER
TREASURES in caskets. Fili approaches the coins scattered
about the ground.
[Fili:]
Seems a shame to leave it lying
around. Anyone could take it.
[Gloin:]
Agreed. Oin, get a shovel.
Thorin inspects TWO SWORDS covered in cobwebs. He hands one
to Gandalf, unsheathing them. He looks in wonder at the
steel.
[Thorin:]
These were not made by any troll.
[Gandalf:]
Nor were they made by any smith
among men.
Gandalf looks closer at the markings on the blade.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
These were forged in Gondolin by
the High Elves of the First Age.
Thorin begins to put the sword away in disgust. Gandalf
glares over at him.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
You could not wish for a finer
blade!
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 48.
56 CONTINUED: 56
Reluctantly, Thorin unsheathes the sword, holding it high
above him.
Near the entrance of the cave, other dwarves fill ONE CHEST
with the coins, burying it in a hole in the ground.
CLOSE ON: Dwalin shakes his head as he watches them.
[Gloin:]
We're making a long term deposit!
ANGLE ON: Thorin walks past them, his new sword tied to his
belt.
[Thorin:]
Come! Let's get out of this foul
place.
The dwarves file behind Thorin, leaving the cave. Gandalf
makes to follow them, when his foot hits against something
METALLIC.
CLOSE ON: With the edge of his staff, Gandalf brushes away
some leaves. A SMALL SWORD, wrapped neatly in its sheath,
lies in the dirt below.
57 EXT. TROLLSHAWS - DAY 57
WIDE ON: Near the mouth of the cave, the dwarves are tending
to their horses. Gandalf emerges from the troll hoard and
approaches Bilbo.
[Gandalf:]
Bilbo, here. This is about your
size.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf hands it to Bilbo. He looks at the weapon,
hesitant.
[Bilbo:]
I can't take this.
[Gandalf:]
The blade is of Elvish make, which
means it will glow blue when orcs
or goblins are nearby.
[Bilbo:]
I have never used a sword in my
life.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 49.
57 CONTINUED: 57
[Gandalf:]
And I hope you'll never have to.
But if you do, remember this: true
courage is about knowing not when
to take a life, but when to spare
one.
Suddenly, LOUD RUSTLING comes from deep within the forest.
[Thorin:]
Something's coming!
Gandalf withdraws his sword, running to the dwarves.
[Gandalf:]
Stay together! Hurry now, arm
yourselves.
Bilbo lingers behind. Slowly, he draws out the sword,
looking in wonder at the weapon's power. He turns, and runs
to join the others.
58 EXT. CLEARING - TROLLSHAWS - DAY 58
Riding at full speed through the trees, RADAGAST THE BROWN,
is led by a RABBIT-DRAWN SLED. He bursts through the woods,
startling the Company.
[Radagast:]
Thieves! Fire! Murder!
ANGLE ON: Radagast draws to a halt. The dwarves all have
their weapons withdrawn. They look to Gandalf for an
explanation of this odd sight.
[Gandalf:]
Radagast! It's Radagast the Brown.
WIDE ON: Gandalf walks towards his fellow wizard. He seems
glad with this new arrival.
59 EXT. CLEARING - TROLLSHAWS - DAY - LATER 59
Gandalf smokes on his pipe with a grave expression. He and
Radagast have gone off several paces from the dwarves.
[Radagast:]
The Greenwood is sick, Gandalf. A
darkness has fallen over it.
Nothing grows anymore, at least
(MORE)

THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 50.
59 CONTINUED: 59
[Radagast:] (cont'd)
nothing good. The air is foul with
decay. But worse are the webs.
[Gandalf:]
Webs? What do you mean?
[Radagast:]
Spiders, Gandalf. Giant ones. Some
kind of spawn of Ungoliant, or I am
not a wizard. I followed their
trail. They came from Dol Guldur.
[Gandalf:]
Dol Guldur? But the old fortress is
abandoned.
[Radagast:]
No, Gandalf, it is not.
CUT TO:
60 EXT. DOL GULDUR - DAY (FLASHBACK) 60
Radagast crosses a stone bridge and enters a DARK RUINED
FORTRESS, his STAFF at the ready.
[Radagast:] (V.O.)
A dark power dwells in there, such
as I have never felt before. It is
the shadow of an ancient horror.
One that can summon the spirits of
the dead.
ANGLE ON: He walks through the seemingly abandoned fortress.
Radagast seems panicked and afraid, clutching his staff with
shaking hands.
Near a HOODED STATUE, Radagast spies a gleam of steel. A
SWORD. He picks it up, looking stunned as he examines the
weapon.
[Radagast:] (V.O.)(CONT'D)
I saw him, Gandalf, from out of the
dark. A Necromancer has come.
Radagast turns, seeing the black shadow of THE NECROMANCER
standing in a near tunnel. It WHISPERS a haunting and
dangerous sounding CHANT.
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 51.
61 EXT. CLEARING - TROLLSHAWS - DAY 61
CLOSE ON: Radagast jumps in fright, recalling the memory. He
looks at Gandalf in an awkward apology.
[Radagast:]
Sorry.
[Gandalf:]
Now, a Necromancer? Are you sure?
ANGLE ON: From his robes, Radagast pulls out a NARROW, CLOTH
WRAPPED PACKAGE. Gandalf unties it and looks inside. He
looks up, concerned.
[Radagast:]
That is not from the world of the
living.
From the distance, WOLVES HOWL. The dwarves perk up in
alarm.
[Bilbo:]
Was that a wolf? Are there wolves
out there?
[Fili:]
Wolf? No, that is not a wolf.
From behind a nearby crag, a WARG appears. It leaps into the
midst of the Company, savage and ferocious. Thorin buries
his sword into it's neck, killing it.
Another charges from behind. Kili draws an arrow, shooting
down the beast. It attempts to pick itself back up, but
Dwalin brings his hammer down upon it. The warg dies with a
WHIMPER.
[Thorin:]
Warg scouts! Which means an Orc
pack is not far behind.
[Bilbo:]
Orc pack?
[Gandalf:]
Who did you tell about your quest,
beyond your kin.
[Thorin:]
No one.

61 CONTINUED: 61
[Gandalf:]
Who did you tell?
[Thorin:]
No one, I swear. What in Durin's
name is going on?
[Gandalf:]
You are being hunted!
[Dwalin:]
We have to get out of here.
WIDE ON: Gloin appears from the crest of the hill.
[Gloin:]
We can't! We have no ponies,
they've bolted!
[Radagast:]
I'll draw them off.
[Gandalf:]
These are Gundabad Wargs, they will
outrun you!
Radagast points to his RABBITS.
[Radagast:]
These are Rhosgobel rabbits! I'd
like to see them try.
CLOSE ON: A wide, toothy grin splits across the wizard's
face. The HOWLING OF WARGS echo across the forest.
62 EXT. FORDS - ERIADOR - DAY 62
CRANE SHOT: WARG SCOUTS search the outskirts of the woods,
led by their commander, YAZNEG. Everything is DEATHLY
SILENT, until -
Radagast shoots out of the trees, mounted on his rabbit-led
sleigh.
[Radagast:]
Come and get me!
Yazneg leads his riders after Radagast, BARKING COMMANDS.
ANGLE ON: Further along the field, Gandalf watches from
behind a LARGE BOULDER. Radagast and the pursuing orcs

disappear into the distance.
[Gandalf:]
Come on.
TRACKING SHOT: Gandalf runs forward, the Company TRAILING
BEHIND HIM. Together, the nine of them dart across the rocky
plain, weapons drawn. Radagast and the orcs can be seen in
the distance.
WIDE ON: Radagast leads the orcs away, his face contorted in
determination. The Company continues to weave in and out of
the rocks, led by Thorin and Gandalf.
ANGLE ON: Suddenly, Thorin stops in his tracks. Radagast and
the orcs run past them, too close for comfort. Gandalf looks
to Bilbo and the dwarves.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
Stay together.
He turns around, leading the dwarves back into the barren
fields. The dwarves stop behind another boulder. OUT OF
BREATH and DISORIENTATED, Balin continue to jog forward.
[Thorin:]
Balin, no!
Thorin grabs him by the collar and pulls Balin behind the
rock. Gandalf watches Radagast closely, waiting for the
right moment.
Finally, Gandalf beckons the dwarves to run. Thorin stays
behind with Gandalf, briefly.
[Thorin:] (CONT'D)
Where are you leading us?
Gandalf does not answer. Discontent, Thorin rejoins with the
dwarves.
CLOSE ON: Yazneg and his orcs continue to chase after
Radagast, their MAKESHIFT SWORDS drawn high in the air. One
orc abruptly comes to a stop. He SMELLS THE AIR. The orc
observes the rocky ford in suspicion.
ANGLE ON: The Company is quick to spot this. They dive
behind an outcropping rock, their breath ragged.
CLOSE ON: The orc, still mounted on top of the warg, climbs
the boulder. He takes another good whiff of the air.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 54.

The dwarves are silent. Thorin looks at Kili and nods.
Slowly, he readies his bow and arrow.
ANGLE ON: Suddenly, Kili springs out from behind the rock.
The orc is quick to grab for his HORN, but Kili looses his
arrow. Both the orc and his warg are shot off of the boulder
and onto the ground.
WIDE ON: From across the ford, Yazneg and the others come to
a halt. GROWLS and SCREECHES echo across the plains.
ANGLE ON: Wounded, the orc rises to his feet again. Dwalin
leaps forward, sending his warhammer crashing down onto the
orc. He dies with a WHIMPER.
Yazneg raises his sword in the air, watching the dwarves
from across the ford.
YAZENG
(in Black Speech;
subtitled)
The Dwarf-scum are over there!
After them!
CRANE SHOT: The Warg Riders change their course to the
dwarves.
ANGLE ON: The Company hears the WARGS HOWLING. Bilbo and the
dwarves are panic-stricken.
[Gandalf:]
Move. Run!
Gandalf leads the Company forward. They sprint past rocks,
boulders, bushes and trees. In the distance, the orcs are
coming closer and closer.
The dwarves continue to flee from the scouts, until -
Yazneg emerges from the crest of the hill. Other orcs files
beside their commander, circling around the Company.
[Kili:]
They're coming!
[Thorin:]
Kili, shoot them! Shoot them down!
Gandalf sees an entrance to an UNDERGROUND CAVERN. One
moment, he is running towards it, and the next moment, he is
gone.

Slowly, the orcs and the wargs march forward. They are
closing in on their prey.
[Fili:]
We're surrounded!
Kili begins loading and unloading arrows as best he can,
taking out an orc here and there.
[Kili:]
Where is Gandalf?
[Dwalin:]
Has he abandoned us?
CLOSE ON: Yazneg approaches the company, riding atop his
warg. He SNARLS VICIOUSLY, giving the Company a deathly
stare. Thorin draws out Orcrist, which GLOWS BLUE.
[Thorin:]
Hold your ground!
ANGLE ON: The dwarves circle up, their weapons raised.
Yazneg rides closer, glaring all the while. The Company
stares back at him, defiant.
Suddenly, Gandalf pops out from the cavern entrance.
[Gandalf:]
This way, you fools!
[Thorin:]
All of you, go, go!
Bilbo and the dwarves dash towards the cavern entrance. One
by one, they start to SLIDE UNDERGROUND. Seeing this, Yazneg
sends his wargs forward.
As the Company slides into the cavern, Thorin slices the
wargs down. He turns to Kili, still shooting in the field.
[Thorin:] (CONT'D)
Kili!
Reluctant, Kili runs forward. He slides into the cavern,
with Thorin filing in behind him.
63 INT. CAVERN - ERIADOR - DAY 63
The dwarves catch their breath in the cavern. Dwalin
investigates an exit in the cave wall. From outside, ELVISH

WIDE ON: A DOZEN MOUNTED ELVES charge forward in full force.
Arrows fly in every direction, bringing down orcs and wargs
alike.
CLOSE ON: Yazneg ROARS IN DEFEAT. An orc is shot down from
his warg. His corpse rolls down the fords, reaching the
cavern entrance.
65 INT. CAVERN - ERIADOR - DAY 65
ANGLE ON: The dead orc rolls into the cavern, an arrow
buried into his head. Thorin plucks out the arrow, examining
its make.
[Thorin:]
Elves.
Thorin drops it in disgust. Dwalin emerges from the crack in
the cave wall.
[Dwalin:]
I cannot see where the pathway
leads. Do we follow it or no?
[Fili:]
Follow it, of course!
The dwarves shuffle forward.
[Gandalf:]
I think that would be wise.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf grins to himself. He knows something.
Bilbo looks at him, suspicious.
66 INT. HIDDEN PASS - ERIADOR - DAY 66
CLOSE ON: Dwalin leads the dwarves through the NARROW GAP in
the cavern. The Company GROANS they push the path.
HIGH ANGLE: Sunlight beams down on the dwarves. They squeeze
through the twisting cliffs, each step becoming more and
more strenuous.

Yes. It feels like - well, like
magic.

That's exactly what it is. A very
powerful magic.
[Dwalin:]
There is light ahead!
Gandalf steps forward with the dwarves. Bilbo looks at him
suspicious.
67 EXT. RIVENDELL OUTSKIRTS - DAY 67
ANGLE ON: The dwarves push through the final stretch of the
pathway. The Company stops at a ridge, looking below them.
WIDE ON: They see a valley gleaming in golden sunlight.
RIVENDELL.
[Gandalf:]
The Valley of Imraldis. In the
Common Tongue, it's known by
another name.
[Bilbo:]
Rivendell.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo is amazed. The dwarves, on the other hand,
are extremely displeased.
[Gandalf:]
Here lies the last homely house
east of the sea.
ANGLE ON: Thorin wheels around and glares at Gandalf.
[Thorin:]
This was your plan all along, to
seek refuge with our enemy.

You have no enemies here, Thorin
Oakenshield. The only ill-will to
be found in this valley is that
which you bring yourself.
[Thorin:]
You think the elves will give our
quest their blessing? They will try
to stop us.
[Gandalf:]
Of course they will. But we have
questions that need to be answered.
If we are to be successful, this
will need to be handled with tact
and respect and no small degree of
charm, which is why you will leave
the talking to me.
WIDE ON: Gandalf begins to make his way down the hill and
into the valley. The dwarves reluctantly follow suit.
68 EXT. COURTYARD - RIVENDELL - DAY 68
ANGLE ON: The Company enters the main courtyard of
Rivendell. The entire place seems to be suspended in an
eternal state of tranquility. Bilbo looks around him, awed
by Rivendell's majesty.
A dark-haired elf, LINDIR, walks down a flight of stairs
nearby. He gives Gandalf a courteous smile.
LINDIR
Mithrandir.
[Gandalf:]
Ah, Lindir!
As the two greet one another, the dwarves MURMUR IN
DISTRUST.
LINDIR
(in Elvish; subtitled)
We heard you had crossed into the
Valley.
[Gandalf:]
I must speak with Lord Elrond.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 59.
68 CONTINUED: 68
LINDIR
My lord Elrond is not here.
[Gandalf:]
Not here? Where is he?
Suddenly, ELVISH HORNS RING OUT across the courtyard. The
Company turns. ARMED HORSEMAN approach the Company at a
rapid rate. The dwarves raise their weapons, defensive.
Elves ride into courtyard, looking down at the dwarves in
confusion. They circle around the Company, banners caught
high in the breeze. Slowly the elves come to a halt.
CLOSE ON: Their leader, ELROND, separates himself from the
others.
[Elrond:]
Gandalf.
The wizard bows gracefully.
[Gandalf:]
Lord Elrond.
(in Elvish; subtitled)
My friend! Where have you been.
[Elrond:]
(in Elvish; subtitled)
We've been hunting a pack of orcs
that came up from the south. We
slew a number near the hidden pass.
ANGLE ON: Elrond dismounts from his horse, where he and
Gandalf embrace. After they part, Elrond begins to tend to
his armor.
[Elrond:] (CONT'D)
Strange for Orcs to come so close
to our borders. Something, or
someone has drawn them near.
[Gandalf:]
That may have been us.
CLOSE ON: Thorin steps forward. Elrond looks upon him with
recognition.
[Elrond:]
Welcome Thorin, son of Thrain.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 60.
68 CONTINUED: (2) 68
[Thorin:]
I do not believe we have met.
[Elrond:]
You have your grandfather's
bearing. I knew Thror when he ruled
under the Mountain.
[Thorin:]
Indeed; he made no mention of you.
Ignoring this insult, Elrond looks to all the dwarves. He
begins to SPEAK IN ELVISH.
[Elrond:]
(In Elvish)
Light the fires, bring forth the
wine. We must feed our guests.
The dwarves grow bellicose and GRIP THEIR WEAPONS UNEASILY.
Gloin jumps forward, raising up his AXE.
[Gloin:]
What is he saying? Does he offer us
insult?
Gandalf steps forward, stern.
[Gandalf:]
No, master Gloin, he's offering you
food.
The dwarves circle up, discussing with one another in LOW
WHISPERS. Gloin turns back to Elrond, disgruntled.
[Gloin:]
Well, in that case, lead on.
ANGLE ON: The elf gives a curt nod and strides up the
stairs. The dwarves follow behind him, uneasy.
69 EXT. ELVEN COURT - RIVENDELL - DAY 69
ANGLE ON: The dwarves sit around a table, OVERFLOWING WITH
FOOD. However, the dwarves pick at the meal, uninterested.
[Dwalin:]
Where's the meat?
CLOSE ON: Oin holds up a VEGETABLE with his knife, looking
at it in disgust.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 61.
69 CONTINUED: 69
[Oin:]
Have they got any chips.
ANGLE ON: Elrond and Gandalf enter the court, walking past
and ELF MAIDEN playing the HARP.
[Gandalf:]
Kind of you to invite us. I'm not
really dressed for dinner.
[Elrond:]
Well, you never are.
They both CHUCKLE, and sit themselves at the head of the
table.
CLOSE ON: From the end of the table, Kili and the elf maid
exchange looks. Kili gives her a WINK.
Kili turns, noticing the other dwarves staring at him. He
SHRUGS.
[Kili:]
I can't say I fancy elf maids
myself. To thin. They're all high
cheekbones and creamy skin. Not
enough facial hair for me.
Although, that one there's not bad.
He cocks his head at a passing elf.
[Dwalin:]
That's not an elf maid.
Kili looks as the elf turns, revealing himself to be no elf
maid.
Shocked, Kili looks to the other dwarves. They ROAR WITH
LAUGHTER, banging against the table in their amusement.
[Kili:]
It's funny.
Kili awkwardly picks at his food. Another elf maid passes
the table, playing the FLUTE. Oin stuffs a NAPKIN into his
hearing trumpet, blocking out the music.
ANGLE ON: Elrond holds out Thorin's sword. He carefully
examines it, running his hand up and down the sheath.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 62.
69 CONTINUED: (2) 69
[Elrond:]
This is Orcrist, the Goblin
Cleaver. A famous blade, forged by
the High Elves of the West. My kin.
May it serve you well.
He hands Orcrist back to Thorin, who accepts with a nod.
Elrond turns now to Gandalf's sword. He slides the sword
several inches out of its sheath.
[Elrond:] (CONT'D)
And this is Glamdring, the
Foe-hammer, sword of the King of
Gondolin. These swords were made
for the goblin wars of the First
Age.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo looks down at his own small sword underneath
the table. Balin gives him a pitying smile.
[Balin:]
I wouldn't bother, laddie. Swords
are named for the great deeds they
do in war.
[Bilbo:]
What are you saying, my sword
hasn't seen battle?
[Balin:]
I'm not actually sure it is a
sword; more of a letter opener,
really.
ANGLE ON: Elrond returns Glamdring to Gandalf. Elrond has an
inquiring look about him.
[Elrond:]
How did you come by these?
[Gandalf:]
We found them in a troll hoard on
the Great East Road, shorty before
we were ambushed by orcs.
[Elrond:]
And what were you doing on the
Great East Road?
No one answers. Thorin, looking perturbed, rises.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 63.

[Thorin:]
Excuse me.
Thorin is quick to leave the court. Gandalf and Elrond
exchange looks.
70 INT. NARSIL CHAMBER - RIVENDELL - DAY 70
Gold morning light streams into the chamber. Bilbo
approaches the SHARDS OF NARSIL, held by a great stone
statue.
He gives the sword a brief look, before turning his
attention to the MURAL OF DAGORLAD. SAURON looms above
ISSILDUR, his BLACK MACE raised high in the air.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo looks at the painting in wonder. His
attention is particularly taken by the GOLD RING around
Sauron's finger. THE ONE RING.
71 EXT. COURTYARD - RIVENDELL - DAY 71
WIDE ON: Bilbo wanders through the courtyard, a peaceful
smile on his face. He stares in admiration at the beauty of
Rivendell, and all its many houses.
CLOSE ON: BIRDS TWITTER past Bilbo. He SIGHS DEEPLY.
72 EXT. BALCONY - RIVENDELL - DAY 72
ANGLE ON: Bilbo stands at the edge of a balcony, looking
down at the rivers and streams below.
Elrond enters the balcony. He strides towards Bilbo and
comes to a stop beside him.
[Elrond:]
Not with your companions?
[Bilbo:]
No, I shan't be missed. The truth
is that most of them don't think I
should be on this journey.
[Elrond:]
Indeed? I've heard that hobbits are
very resilient.
[Bilbo:]
Really?
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 64.
72 CONTINUED: 72
CLOSE ON: Elrond nods.
[Elrond:]
I've also heard they're fond of the
comforts of home.
[Bilbo:]
I've heard that it is unwise to
seek the council of elves, for they
will answer with yes and no.
Elrond looks down at Bilbo, giving him a warm smile. The
hobbit makes a NERVOUS CHUCKLE.
[Elrond:]
You are always welcome to stay
here, if that is your wish.
He turns and leaves the balcony. Bilbo stares after him,
considerate.
73 INT. ELROND'S CHAMBERS - RIVENDELL - NIGHT 73
ANGLE ON: Gandalf, Thorin, Bilbo and Balin are gathered in
Elrond's chambers. Thorin stares at Elrond, nothing but PURE
RESENTMENT in his eyes.
[Thorin:]
Our business is no concern of
elves.
[Gandalf:]
For goodness sake, Thorin, show him
the map.
[Thorin:]
It is the legacy of my people; it
is mine to protect, as are its
secrets.
[Gandalf:]
Save me from the stubbornness of
dwarves. Your pride will be your
downfall. You stand here in the
presence of one of the few in
Middle Earth who can read that map.
Show it to Lord Elrond!
Everyone looks to Thorin, waiting. Reluctantly, he draws the
map out of his coat.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 65.
73 CONTINUED: 73
[Balin:]
Thorin, no!
Balin holds out his hand, but Thorin brushes him aside.
Thorin hands Elrond the map.
[Elrond:]
Erebor. What is your interest in
this map?
CLOSE ON: Thorin opens his mouth to speak, but Gandalf
answers first.
[Gandalf:]
It's mainly academic. As you know,
this sort of artifact sometimes
contains hidden text. You still
read ancient dwarvish, do you not?
Elrond walks several paces off, into the moonlight. The map
is bathed in PEARLY WHITE LIGHT.
[Elrond:]
(in Elvish)
Moon runes.
[Gandalf:]
Moon runes? Of course; an easy
thing to miss.
[Elrond:]
Well, in this case, that is true;
moon runes can only be read by the
light of a moon the same shape and
season as the day on which they
were written.
[Thorin:]
Can you read them?
ANGLE ON: Elrond nods. He walks out of the chambers, Gandalf
and the others following behind.
74 EXT. CLIFFSIDE - RIVENDELL - NIGHT 74
WIDE ON: The group enters an open area on the side of a
cliff. Waterfalls rush on every side, ROARING DEAFENINGLY.
Elrond lies the map on a LARGE CRYSTALLINE TABLE.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 66.
74 CONTINUED: 74
[Elrond:]
These runes were written on a
Midsummer's Eve by the light of a
crescent moon nearly two hundred
years ago. It would seem you were
meant to come to Rivendell. Fate is
with you, Thorin Oakenshield; the
same moon shines upon us tonight.
CLOSE ON: They look up. Clouds pass over the moon, shining
down on the table.
ANGLE ON: Light flows through the map. GLOWING WHITE RUNES
fade into view.
[Elrond:] (CONT'D)
Stand by the gray stone when the
thrush knocks, and the setting sun
with the last light of Durin's Day
will shine upon the keyhole.
[Bilbo:]
Durin's Day?
[Gandalf:]
It is the start of the dwarves'
near year, when the last moon of
autumn and the first sun of winter
appear in the sky together.
[Thorin:]
This is ill news. Summer is
passing. Durin's day will soon be
upon us.
[Balin:]
We still have time.
[Bilbo:]
Time? For what?
[Balin:]
To find the entrance. We have to be
standing at exactly the right spot
at exactly the right time. Then,
and only then, can the door be
opened.
[Elrond:]
So this is your purpose, to enter
the Mountain?
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 67.
74 CONTINUED: (2) 74
[Thorin:]
What of it?
[Elrond:]
There are some who would not deem
it wise.
Thorin takes back the map gruffly. Gandalf looks to Elrond.
[Gandalf:]
What do you mean?
[Elrond:]
You are not the only guardian to
stand watch over Middle Earth.
CLOSE ON: Elrond turns, leaving the others behind. Gandalf
turns slowly, lost in deep thought.
75 INT. DWARVEN CHAMBER - RIVENDELL - NIGHT 75
ANGLE ON: The dwarves circle around a CAMPFIRE made from
burning ELVISH FURNITURE in their quarters. Fili roasts a
SAUSAGE above the fire.
He looks over at Gloin, sitting on a bench.
[Fili:]
Gloin!
Fili throws the sausage to Gloin. As Gloin catches it, the
bench breaks beneath him. The dwarves LAUGH UPROARIOUSLY.
76 EXT. STAIRWAY - RIVENDELL - NIGHT 76
WIDE ON: Bilbo wanders onto a large stairway. His face is
etched with indecisiveness.
From far below the staircase, Gandalf and Elrond walk across
a bridge. Curious, Bilbo watches them.
[Gandalf:]
Of course I was going to tell you,
I was waiting for this very chance.
And really, I think you can trust
that I know what I am doing.
[Elrond:]
Do you? That dragon has slept for
60 years. What will happen if your

76 CONTINUED: 76
[Elrond:] (cont'd)
plan should fail, if you wake that
beast?
[Gandalf:]
What if we succeed? If the dwarves
take back the mountain, our
defenses in the east will be
strengthened.
[Elrond:]
It is a dangerous move, Gandalf.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo notices that Thorin is standing behind him.
He too listens in on the argument.
[Gandalf:]
It is also dangerous to do nothing.
The throne of Erebor is Thorin's
birthright, what is it you fear?
[Elrond:]
Have you forgotten? A strain of
madness runs deep in that family.
His grandfather lost his mind, his
father succumbed to the same
sickness. Can you swear Thorin
Oakenshield will not also fall?
Gandalf, these decisions do not
rest with us alone. It is not up to
you or me to redraw the map of
Middle Earth.
Bilbo looks back at Thorin. His face is unreadable.
77 EXT. PAVILION - RIVENDELL - NIGHT 77
ANGLE ON: Gandalf and Elrond march up a flight of marble
stairs.
[Gandalf:]
With or without our help, these
dwarves will march on the mountain.
They are determined to reclaim
their homeland. I do not believe
Thorin Oakenshield feels that he's
answerable to anyone. Nor for that
matter am I.
[Elrond:]
It is not me you must answer to.

THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 69.
77 CONTINUED: 77
Elrond leads the wizard into a pavilion. There, a tall,
beautiful elf stands framed against the moonlight. She
slowly turns around, revealing herself to be GALADRIEL.
[Gandalf:]
Lady Galadriel.
[Galadriel:]
Mithrandir.
(in Elvish; subtitled)
It has been a long time.
Gandalf gives her a gracious bow.
[Gandalf:]
(in Elvish; subtitled)
Age may have changed me, but not so
the Lady of Lorien.
Galadriel smiles at the wizard.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
I had no idea Lord Elrond had sent
for you.
CLOSE ON: A voice SOUNDS FROM THE DARKNESS. Gandalf turns to
see [Saruman:] THE WHITE, sitting in a far corner.
[Saruman:]
He didn't. I did.
Gandalf bows.
[Gandalf:]
Saruman.
[Saruman:]
You've been busy of late, my
friend.
78 EXT. PAVILION - RIVENDELL - DAY 78
ANGLE ON: Dawn breaks behind the White Council. Gandalf and
Saruman are seated at a MARBLE TABLE, while Galadriel and
Elrond circle around them.
[Saruman:]
Tell me, Gandalf. Did you think
these plans and schemes of yours
would go unnoticed.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 70.
78 CONTINUED: 78
[Gandalf:]
Unnoticed? No, I'm simply doing
what I feel to be right.
[Galadriel:]
The dragon has long been on your
mind.
[Gandalf:]
It is true, my lady. Smaug owes
allegiance to no one. But if he
should side with the enemy, a
dragon could be used to terrible
effect.
[Elrond:]
What do you mean?
[Gandalf:]
There is something at work beyond
the evil of Smaug. Something far
more powerful. We can remain blind
to it, but it will not be ignoring
us, that I can promise you. A
sickness lies over the Greenwood.
The woodsmen who live there now
call it Mirkwood, and they say...
His voice TRAILS OFF, uncertain.
[Saruman:]
Well, don't stop now. Tell us what
the woodsmen say.
[Gandalf:]
They speak of a Necromancer living
in Dol Guldur, a sorcerer who can
summon the dead.
[Saruman:]
That's absurd. No such power exists
in this world. This Necromancer is
nothing more than a mortal man. A
conjurer dabbling in black magic.
[Gandalf:]
And so I thought too, but Radagast
has seen -

[Saruman:]
Radagast? Do not speak to of
Radagast the Brown. He is a foolish
fellow.
Gandalf SIGHS as Saruman goes on a tirade about the brown
wizard.
Galadriel stops in her tracks, staring towards Gandalf. She
begins to speak TELEPATHICALLY.
[Galadriel:] (V.O.)
You carry something. It came to you
from Radagast. He found it in Dol
Guldur.
[Gandalf:] (V.O.)
Yes.
[Galadriel:] (V.O.)
Show me.
ANGLE ON: From out of his robes, Gandalf slowly lifts out
Radagast's PACKAGE. He rests it on the table, letting out a
DULL THUD.
[Elrond:]
What is that?
[Galadriel:]
A relic of Mordor.
Elrond reaches towards the package, unwrapping it.
CLOSE ON: The blade from Dol Guldur rests inside. The White
Council looks shocked.
[Elrond:]
A Morgul blade.
[Galadriel:]
Made for the Witch-king of Angmar
and buried with him. When Angmar
fell, men of the north took his
body and all that he possessed and
sealed it within the High Fells of
Rhudaur. Deep within the rock they
buried them, in a tomb so dark it
would never come to light.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 72.
78 CONTINUED: (3) 78
[Elrond:]
That is not possible. A powerful
spell lies upon those tombs; they
cannot be opened.
[Saruman:]
What proof do we have this weapon
came from Angmar's grave.
[Gandalf:]
I have none.
[Saruman:]
Because there is none! Let us
examine what we know. A single Orc
pack has dared to cross the
Bruinen, a dagger from a bygone age
has been found, and a human
sorcerer who calls himself the
Necromancer has taken up residence
in a ruined fortress. It's not so
very much, after all.
WIDE ON: Lindir rushes into the pavilion, BREATHLESS. The
council turns to look at him.
LINDIR
My lord Elrond, the dwarves,
they've gone.
CLOSE ON: Elrond and Gandalf exchange stunned looks.
79 EXT. RIVENDELL OUTSKIRTS - DAY 79
WIDE ON: All of the dwarves are packed, hiking along the
path leaving Rivendell.
[Thorin:]
Be on your guard; we're about to
step over the edge of the wild.
Balin, you know these paths, lead
on.
[Balin:]
Aye.

longing.

follows behind the dwarves.
80 EXT. PAVILION - RIVENDELL - DAY 80
WIDE ON: Galadriel and Gandalf stand at the edge of the
pavillion, the sun rising behind them. Elrond and Saruman
are gone.
[Galadriel:]
You will follow them?
[Gandalf:]
Yes.
[Galadriel:]
You are right to help Thorin
Oakenshield. But I fear this quest
has set in motion forces we do not
yet understand. The riddle of the
Morgul blade must be answered.
Something moves in the shadows,
unseen, hidden from our sight. It
will not show itself, not yet. But
everyday it grows with strength.
You must be careful.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf turns and paces up and down the pavillion.
[Galadriel:] (CONT'D)
Mithrandir, why the halfling?
Gandalf stares thoughtfully into the sunrise.
[Gandalf:]
I do not know. Saruman believes
that it is only great power that
can hold evil in check. But that is
not what I have found. I've found
that it is the small things,
everyday deeds of ordinary folk
that keeps the darkness at bay.
Simple acts of kindess and love.
Why Bilbo Baggins? Perhaps it is
because I'm afraid and he gives me
courage.

Galadriel stands in front of Gandalf, taking his old, weary

Do not be afraid, Mithrandir. You
are not alone.
She tucks a LOOSE STRAND of Gandalf's hair back into place.
[Galadriel:] (CONT'D)
(in Elvish; subtitled)
If you should ever need my help, I
will come.
Gandalf bows, and Galadriel gently moves her hands away from
his. Gandalf looks up. Galadriel is GONE.
81 EXT. ERIADOR - DAY 81
CRANE SHOT: The dwarves trudge through the WILDERNESS OF
ERIADOR. The Misty Mountains are plain in the distance,
capped with snow. Over ranges, rivers and waterfalls they
pass, silent with determination.
Slowly, their path becomes higher and higher, looming over
the fields below. The Misty Mountains grow nearer with every
step.
82 EXT. MISTY MOUNTAINS - DAY 82
Finally, the Company finds themselves climbing the VAST
MOUNTAIN RANGE, through rock and snow, framed against the
blue sky behind them.
83 EXT. MISTY MOUNTAINS - NIGHT 83
WIDE ON: A FIERCE STORM RAGES in the air. LIGHTNING STRIKES
here and there, and RAIN POURS DOWN without mercy.
ANGLE ON: Thorin leads the dwarves across a NARROW,
DANGEROUS TRAIL on the side of the mountain. A cliff lies on
one side of the path, with a sheer drop on the other.
[Thorin:]
Hold on!
The dwarves carefully make their way across the ridge,
half-drowned in rain. As Bilbo walks, the stone beneath him
gives way. Dwalin manages to catch him in the nick of time.

[Thorin:]
We must find shelter!
CLOSE ON: Dwalin points up, looking at something in the
distance.
[Dwalin:]
Look out!
WIDE ON: A MASSIVE BOULDER hurtles through the air. It hits
the mountainside above the dwarves, sending rocks crumbling
down around them as they press themselves against the
mountain.
CLOSE ON: Balin steps forward, pointing up at the sky.
[Balin:]
This is no thunder storm! It's a
thunder battle! Look!
WIDE ON: A MASSIVE STONE GIANT rears up from a nearby
mountain. It rips a giant CHUNK OF STONE from the top of the
mountain.
[Fili:]
Well, bless me! The legends are
true! Giants; stone giants!
The stone giant throws the rock across the valley. It
crashes into ANOTHER STONE GIANT, rising from the
mountainside. The dwarves watch, caught in the middle.
[Thorin:]
Take cover, you'll fall!
ANGLE ON: Debris begin to fall over the Company once again.
The dwarves hold onto the mountainside as the ground beneath
them begins to CRACK and SPLIT, separating the dwarves.
[Fili:]
Kili, grab my hand! Kili!
Kili, Oin, Gloin and Thorin begin to drift away from the
others.
WIDE ON: The dwarves stand on the knees of a THIRD STONE
GIANT, who rises slowly to the fight. The second stone giant
lumbers over, HEADBUTTING the third giant.
ANGLE ON: As the giant falls backwards, Bilbo and the
dwarves are sent TUMBLING forwards and backwards, hanging
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 76.
83 CONTINUED: (2) 83
onto the mountainside for dear life. Thorin, Oin, Gloin and
Kili manage to jump onto the still side of the mountain.
WIDE ON: The third giant rises back up again. Slowly, the
second throws a punch, sending it falling back into its
place on the mountain.
ANGLE ON: Thorin and the other watch, helpless, as the rest
of the Company is seemingly crushed between the stone.
[Thorin:]
NO!
Thorin runs forward across the ledge. He runs along the
path, finding them alive and well.
[Gloin:]
It's alright! They're alive!
Fili scans the mountainside. There is no side of Bilbo.
[Fili:]
Where's Bilbo?
He looks over the edge, shocked to find Bilbo dangling off
the edge of the cliff.
[Fili:] (CONT'D)
There!
CLOSE ON: The dwarves clamor around the cliff, trying to
pull him up.
ANGLE ON: Thorin swings down on the cliff next to Bilbo and
boosts him up. The others haul him onto the ledge. Thorin
climbs up behind Bilbo.
[Dwalin:]
I thought we'd lost our burglar.
[Thorin:]
He's been lost ever since he left
home. He should never have come. He
has no place amongst us.
(turns to the dwarves)
Now, we must find shelter.
The dwarves nod in agreement, following after Thorin's lead.

84 INT. CAVE - MISTY MOUNTAINS - NIGHT 84
ANGLE ON: The Company enters a cave. It is dark, still and
silent.
[Dwalin:]
It looks safe enough.
[Thorin:]
Search to the back; caves in
mountains are seldom unoccupied.
Dwalin searches the back of the cave, LANTERN IN HAND. After
a brief investigation, he returns to the others.
[Dwalin:]
There's nothing here.
Gloin drops a BUNDLE OF WOOD on the floor. He grins, rubbing
his hands together.
[Gloin:]
Right then! Let's get a fire
started.
[Thorin:]
No. No fires, not in this place.
Get some sleep. We start at first
light.
[Balin:]
We were to wait in the mountains
until Gandalf joined us. That was
the plan.
[Thorin:]
Plans change.
Thorin turns to Fili.
[Thorin:] (CONT'D)
Fili, take the first watch.
85 INT. CAVE - MISTY MOUNTAINS - NIGHT - LATER 85
WIDE ON: All of the dwarves are asleep, resting on top of
PILES OF LUGGAGE.
CLOSE ON: From the corner of the cave, Bilbo opens his eyes.
Seeing that no one is awake, he quietly rolls up his
blankets and packs his things.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 78.
85 CONTINUED: 85
ANGLE ON: Packed and ready, Bilbo makes for the cave
entrance. Fili sees him and jumps up.
[Fili:]
Where do you think you're going?
[Bilbo:]
Back to Rivendell.
[Fili:]
No, no, you can't turn back now,
you're part of the company. You're
one of us.
[Bilbo:]
I'm not though, am I? Thorin said I
should never have come, and he was
right. I'm not a Took, I'm a
Baggins, I don't know what I was
thinking. I should have never ran
out my door.
CLOSE ON: Thorin, awake, stares thoughtfully at the walls,
listening.
[Fili:]
You're homesick; I understand.
[Bilbo:]
No, you don't! You don't
understand, none of you do - you're
dwarves! You're used to this life,
to living on the road, never
settling in one place, not
belonging anywhere.
Fili looks slightly offended. Bilbo gives an apologetic
look.
[Bilbo:]
I'm sorry, I didn't mean -
Fili shakes his head, looking down at his sleeping
companions.
[Fili:]
No, you're right. We don't belong
anywhere.
(looks to Bilbo)
I wish you all the luck in the
world. I really do.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 79.
85 CONTINUED: (2) 85
Beaming, Fili places his hand on Bilbo's shoulder. Bilbo and
Fili exchange one final look, before Bilbo turns around to
the exit.
[Fili:]
What's that?
Fili points to his belt. Bilbo looks down. He pulls his
sword partway out of its sheath. IT GLOWS BLUE.
ANGLE ON: Suddenly, STRANGE MECHANICAL NOISES comes from the
ground. Thorin raises his head, seeing the sandy ground
beneath him CRACK APART.
[Thorin:]
Wake up! Wake up!
Before anyone can react, the cave floor COLLAPSES DOWNWARDS.
86 INT. GOBLIN CHUTE - MISTY MOUNTAINS - NIGHT 86
The entire Company goes SAILING DOWN A CHUTE, sliding
through tunnels and passages. The dwarves SCREAM as they are
thrown downwards.
87 INT. GOBLIN CAGES - MISTY MOUNTAINS - NIGHT 87
ANGLE ON: All of the dwarves fall onto a WOODEN CAGE. As
they struggle to rise, a HORDE OF GOBLINS attack them.
CLOSE ON: The creatures viciously take their weapons,
pushing them forwards. The dwarves attempt to fight back, to
no avail.
ANGLE ON: As they are led away, Bilbo crouches out of sight.
The passing goblins do not even spare him a glance.
CLOSE ON: Oin looks over his shoulder and sees Bilbo. Before
he can do anything, the goblins push him forward.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo scampers to hide behind the RAILINGS. He
watches as the goblins proceed through the darkness. Bilbo
draws out his sword. He follows behind the goblin's path,
unseen.
Suddenly, ONE GOBLIN jumps out in front of him. Armed with a
DAGGER, the goblin rushes forward. Steel meets steel, and
Bilbo barely manages to keep himself alive.
The goblin LEAPS on top of Bilbo, biting into his shoulder.
Bilbo staggers back, falling over the railings. Together,

Bilbo and the goblin fall through the dark chasm, SCREAMING.
88 INT. GOBLIN TOWN - MISTY MOUNTAINS - NIGHT 88
TRACKING SHOT: The goblins lead the dwarves down a vast
network of TUNNELS AND WOODEN BRIDGES. Thousands of other
goblins look on, SNARLING.
89 INT. THRONE ROOM - GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT 89
WIDE ON: They are led into the massive throne room and
brought to the feet of THE GREAT GOBLIN.
CLOSE ON: With a WHEEZE and a COUGH, The Great Goblin
lounges on his throne. He is far larger and far uglier than
any other goblin.
ANGLE ON: The goblins pile the dwarves' weapons together.
The Great Goblin leaps from his throne, leaning on a
SKULL-TOPPED MACE for support.
GREAT GOBLIN
Who would be so bold as to come
armed into my kingdom? Spies?
Thieves? Assassins?
His second in command, GRINNAH, steps forward.
GRINNAH
Dwarves, your malevolence.
GREAT GOBLIN
Dwarves?
GRINNAH
We found them on the Front Porch.
GREAT GOBLIN
Well, don't just stand there!
Search them! Every crack, every
crevice.
The goblins rush forward, searching thoroughly. Whatever
they find, the goblins throw on the ground and destroy.
CLOSE ON: One particular goblin grabs Oin's hearing trumpet
and crushes it underfoot.
GREAT GOBLIN
What are you doing in these parts?
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 81.
89 CONTINUED: 89
ANGLE ON: The dwarves hesitate. The Great Goblin grins.
GREAT GOBLIN (CONT'D)
Very well, if they will not talk,
we'll make them squawk! Bring out
the mangler! Bring out the bone
breaker! Start with the youngest.
He points to Kili. Thorin quickly steps forward.
[Thorin:]
Wait!
GREAT GOBLIN
Well, well, well, look who it is!
Thorin, son of Thrain, son of
Thror, King Under The Mountain.
The Great Goblin gives a mocking bow.
GREAT GOBLIN (CONT'D)
Oh, but I'm forgetting, you don't
have a mountain. And you're not a
king. Which makes you nobody,
really. But I know someone who
would pay a pretty price for your
head. Just the head, nothing
attached. Perhaps you know of whom
I speak. A vengeful enemy of yours.
CLOSE ON: Thorin looks up in disbelief.
[Thorin:]
Bolg of the North?
The other dwarves look shocked. The Great Goblin chuckles at
their surprise.
ANGLE ON: He turns to the tiny GOBLIN SCRIBE, sitting in a
BASKET.
GREAT GOBLIN
Send word to Bolg of the North.
Tell him, I have found his prize.
The scribe writes down this message on a SLATE. With a
CACKLE, he PULLS A LEVER and sails off into the dark caverns
below.
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 82.
90 INT. GOBLIN TUNNELS - MISTY MOUNTAINS - NIGHT 90
CLOSE ON: Bilbo lies in a clump of mushrooms. Slowly, he
regains consciousness. The goblin he dueled lies further
off, GASPING FOR BREATH.
ANGLE ON: Out of the darkness, a strange figure approaches.
Walking on all fours, it crawls to the goblin. It is GOLLUM.
[Gollum:]
Yes, yes, yes!
(starts to cough)
Gollum. Gollum.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo hides behind the mushrooms. He watches
Gollum circle around the goblin.
ANGLE ON: Gollum drags the goblin by his feet. Suddenly, it
springs to life, grabbing Gollum. In response, Gollum grabs
a near ROCK, and pounds it against the goblin's head.
CLOSE ON: As Gollum beats down on the goblin, a GOLDEN RING
falls out of his loincloth. It lands on the ground with a
SOFT THUD.
ANGLE ON: The goblin falls backwards, knocked out. Gollum
continues to pull the goblin away.
[Gollum:] (CONT'D)
Nasty goblinses. Better than old
bones, precious. Better than
nothing!
Gollum rounds a corner, out of sight. Once he is gone, Bilbo
jumps out of the mushroom patch and retrieves his sword. It
still GLOWS BLUE.
CLOSE ON: By the light of the sword, Bilbo sees the Ring
below him. Intrigued, he picks it up and examines it.
Gollum begins to MOAN in the distance. Without a second
thought, Bilbo drops the Ring in his pocket. He follows the
sound of Gollum's voice.
[Smeagol:]
Too many boneses, precious. Not
enough flesh!
[Gollum:]
Shut up! Get its skin off. Start
with its head.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 83.
90 CONTINUED: 90
WIDE ON: Bilbo creeps around the corner. He sees Gollum, or
in this case SMEAGOL, silhouetted on top of an OUTCROPPING
ROCK in the middle of a SMALL LAKE. Smeagol sings joyfully
as he beats the goblin.
[Smeagol:]
(singing)
The cold hard lands, they bites our
hands, they gnaws our feet. The
rocks and stones, they're like old
bones, all bare of meat. Cold as
death, they have no breath, its
good to eat.
With a HOWL, the goblin wakes again, but Gollum is too quick
for him. He smashes in the goblin's head with another stone.
Suddenly, Gollum looks up and sees the glow of Bilbo's
sword.
ANGLE ON: Panicked, Bilbo dives behind a boulder. The light
of his sword slowly FLICKERS AWAY. The goblin is dead. Bilbo
peers over at Gollum's rock with caution.
He is gone.
CLOSE ON: Gollum is mounted on a SMALL, WOODEN BOAT. Using
his hands as paddles, he swims across the lake.
Bilbo still hides behind the rock. His breath is QUICK AND
PAINED. He is afraid.
From behind him, he hears a SCUFFLING NOISE. Bilbo turns to
look up. Gollum is climbing the rock above. He jumps down,
and gives Bilbo a toothy grin.
[Gollum:]
Bless us and splash us, precious!
That's a meaty mouthful!
ANGLE ON: Gollum crawls towards Bilbo. The hobbit points the
tip of his sword at Gollum's throat. He retreats in fear.
[Gollum:] (CONT'D)
Gollum. Gollum.
[Bilbo:]
Back! Stay back! I'm warning you,
don't come any closer.
Bilbo rises, pointing the blade down at Gollum.

[Gollum:]
It's got an elvish blade, but its
not an elfs. Not an elfs, no.
CLOSE ON: Gollum squints up at Bilbo, perplexed.
[Gollum:] (CONT'D)
What is it, precious? What is it?
[Bilbo:]
My name is Bilbo Baggins.
[Gollum:]
Bagginses? What is a Bagginses,
precious?
[Bilbo:]
I'm a hobbit, from the Shire.
[Gollum:]
Oh! We like goblinses, batses and
fishes, but we haven't tried
hobbitses before. Is it soft? Is it
juicy?
Gollum steps closer to Bilbo, mouth watering. Bilbo holds
out his sword, waving it wildly about.
[Bilbo:]
Now, now, keep your distance! I'll
use this if I have to!
WIDE ON: Gollum SNARLS LOUDLY. It echos across the cave.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
I don't want any trouble, do you
understand? Just show me the way to
get out of here, and I'll be on my
way!
[Gollum:]
Why? Is it lost?
[Bilbo:]
Yes, yes, and I want to be unlost
as soon as possible.
Gollum's face lights up. Smeagol has returned.

[Smeagol:]
Oh! We knows! We knows safe paths

dark.
[Gollum:]
Shut up!
Bilbo frowns.
[Bilbo:]
I didn't say anything.
[Gollum:]
Wasn't talking to you.
CLOSE ON: Gollum crouches behind an OUTCROPPING STONE.
[Smeagol:]
Well, yes, we was, precious, we
was.
[Bilbo:]
Look, I don't know what your game
is, but I -
Suddenly, Smeagol leaps onto the stone, excited.
[Smeagol:]
Games? We love games, doesn't we,
precious?
(to Bilbo)
Does it like games? Does it? Does
it? Does it like to play?
[Bilbo:]
Maybe?
Smeagol holds up his hand and begins to recite a riddle.
[Smeagol:]
What has roots as nobody sees, is
taller than trees. Up, up, up it
goes, and yet never grows.
Bilbo takes some time to think it over.
[Bilbo:]
The mountain.
WIDE ON: Smeagol nods and lets out a BREATHLESS LAUGHTER.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 86.

[Smeagol:]
Yes, yes! Oh, let's have another
one. Come on, do it again, do it
again! Ask us.
[Gollum:]
NO! No more riddles! Finish him
off! Finish him now! Gollum!
Gollum!
ANGLE ON: Gollum begins to lunge at Bilbo. Bilbo holds up a
hand.
[Bilbo:]
No! No! I want to play, I do. I can
see that you are very good at this.
So, why don't we have a game of
riddles? Yes? Just you and me.
Smeagol scuttles forward, excited.
[Smeagol:]
Just us?
[Bilbo:]
Yes. Yes. And if I win, you show me
the way out.
CLOSE ON: With a GROWL, Gollum turns away. He crouches
behind the stone, speaking to his Smeagol half.
[Gollum:]
And if it loses? What then?
[Smeagol:]
If it loses, precious, then we eats
it.
Smeagol pops out from behind the stone.
[Smeagol:] (CONT'D)
If Baggins loses, we eats it whole.
Bilbo pauses, digesting this information. Reluctantly, he
begins to sheath his sword.
[Bilbo:]
Fair enough.
Smeagol looks up at him, expectant.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 87.
90 CONTINUED: (5) 90
[Smeagol:]
Well, Baggins first.
[Bilbo:]
Thirty white horses on a red hill.
First they champ, then they stamp,
then they stand still.
Smeagol thinks long and hard. Finally, he replies.
[Smeagol:]
Teeth?
Bilbo looks unhappy; Smeagol is correct.
[Smeagol:] (CONT'D)
(laughing)
Teeth! Yes, my precious! But we, we
only have nine.
Smeagol opens his mouth wide, displaying his nine teeth.
Bilbo is disgusted.
[Smeagol:] (CONT'D)
Our turn. Voiceless it cries,
wingless flutter, toothless bites,
mouthless mutters.
ANGLE ON: Smegol creeps forward, unsettling Bilbo. He tries
is best to keep a rock between the two of them.
[Bilbo:]
Just a minute.
Bilbo walks off to the side of the lake. Smeagol suddenly
becomes excited.
[Smeagol:]
Oh, we knows! We knows!
[Gollum:]
Shut up!
CLOSE ON: Bilbo watches the lake water, thinking. A SOFT
BREEZE ruffles the surface of the water. Bilbo grins.
[Bilbo:]
Wind. It's wind. Of course it is!
ANGLE ON: Gollum GROWLS, furious.

THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 88.

[Gollum:]
Very clever, hobbitses, very
clever.
Gollum clambers forward, SNARLING. Bilbo unsheathes his
sword, pointing it down at Gollum.
[Bilbo:]
A box without hinges, key or lid,
yet golden treasure inside is hid.
Smeagol turns around, MUTTERING to himself.
[Smeagol:]
Box... and a lid, then a key...
[Bilbo:]
Well?
[Smeagol:]
It's nasty.
Smeagol paces up and down the slab of rock. Bilbo looms over
him, triumphant.
[Bilbo:]
Give up?
[Smeagol:]
Give us a chance, precious, give us
a chance!
Frustrated, Smeagol pounds down at the floor. He PUCKERS HIS
FACE, deep in furious thought. Suddenly, he opens his eyes,
smiling widely.
[Smeagol:]
Eggses!
Bilbo frowns. Smeagol has gotten right yet another riddle.
[Smeagol:] (CONT'D)
Eggses! Wet, crunchy, little
eggses. Grandmother taught us to
suck them, yes!
A BAT SQUEALS in the distance. Startled, Bilbo looks around
for the bat. He looks back down. Smeagol is gone, but his
voice echoes from across the cave.

[Smeagol:]
We have one for you. All things it

flowers. Gnaws iron, bites steel,
grinds hards stone to meal.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo paces around the rock, sword raised
defensively. Eyebrows furrowed, he thinks to solve the
riddle.
[Gollum:]
Answer us!
[Bilbo:]
Give me a moment, please! I gave
you a good long while.
Bilbo walks in circles around the slab, shaking his head.
[Bilbo:]
I don't know this one.
[Gollum:]
Is it tasty? Is it scrumptious? Is
it crunchable?
Out of nowhere, Gollum appears behind Bilbo and grabs his
neck. Bilbo jumps away, aiming his sword straight at Gollum.
[Bilbo:]
Let me think. Let me think.
Slowly, Bilbo backs away. Smeagol watches with a grin.
[Smeagol:]
It's stuck. Bagginses is stuck.
Bilbo paces back and forth, frustrated.
[Smeagol:]
Time's up.
CLOSE ON: Smeagol gives an eerie smile. Bilbo turns around,
a grin is wide on his face.
[Bilbo:]
Time. The answer is time.

Actually, it wasn't that hard.

Last question. Last chance.
Behind his back, Gollum grasps onto a ROCK. Bilbo doesn't
notice. He is too busy thinking of a riddle.
[Gollum:] (CONT'D)
Ask us. Ask us!
[Bilbo:]
Yes, yes, all right.
WIDE ON: Bilbo strolls to the edge of the bank. He
absentmindedly rubs his pocket. He feels the Ring inside.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
What have I got in my pocket?
[Smeagol:]
That's not fair. That's not fair,
it's against the rules!
ANGLE ON: Smeagol throws down the rock in his fury. Bilbo
looks at it, startled.
[Smeagol:] (CONT'D)
Ask us another one!
Bilbo steps closer, shaking his head.
[Bilbo:]
No, no, no. You said, 'ask me a
question'. Well, I did. What have I
got in my pocket?
[Smeagol:]
Three guesses, precious. It must
give us three!
[Bilbo:]
Three guesses. Very well, guess
away.

Handses.
Bilbo pulls his hands out just in time.

Wrong, guess again.

Oh, shut up!
[Bilbo:]
Wrong again. Last guess.
[Smeagol:]
String! Or nothing.
[Bilbo:]
Two guesses at once. Wrong, both
times.
Smeagol falls to the floor, CRYING in his defeat. Bilbo
looms over him, victorious.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
Come on then, I won the game. You
promised to show me the way out.
CLOSE ON: Gollum gets to his feet, his back turned.
[Gollum:]
Did we say so, precious? Did we say
so?
Slowly, Gollum turns around. He glares up at Bilbo.
[Gollum:] (CONT'D)
What has it got in its pocketses?
[Bilbo:]
That's no concern of yours. You
lost.
Gollum grins as he approaches Bilbo. He reaches for
something hidden at his side.
His face registers in shock. Whatever he is looking for, it
is not there.

Where is it? Where is it? No! No!
No!

Lost! Curses and splashes, my
precious is lost!
It dawns on Bilbo. He takes the Ring from his pocket and
hides it behind his back.
[Bilbo:]
What have you lost?
[Gollum:]
Mustn't ask us! Not its business!
Gollum, gollum!
CLOSE ON: Gollum leans over the edge of the lake, SOBBING.
He stares at his reflection, and slowly his cries begin to
cease. Gollum's face becomes contorted in anger.
[Gollum:] (CONT'D)
What has it got in its nasty,
little pocketses?
Bilbo's grasp around the Ring tightens. Slowly, Gollum turns
to look at Bilbo. His face is pale with shock.
[Gollum:] (CONT'D)
He stole it. He stole it! HE STOLE
IT!
SNARLING, Gollum throws a STONE at Bilbo. He manages to
deflect it with his sword, and runs off, deeper into the
tunnels. Gollum chases after him, ROARING.
91 INT. THRONE ROOM - GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT 91

TORTURE into the throne room. The Great Goblin prances
around his throne, singing a HORRENDOUS SONG.
GREAT GOBLIN

Bones will be shattered, necks will

They HOWL IN FEAR.
GREAT GOBLIN
I know that sword! It is the Goblin
Cleaver! The Biter! The blade that
sliced a thousand necks!

WEAPONS and beat the dwarves to the ground.

Cut off his head!

above his head.
WIDE ON: Suddenly, there is a vast EXPLOSION OF WHITE LIGHT.
The goblins and the torture machines go FLYING, while the
dwarves are knocked to the ground.
The explosion passes. A shadow is framed against the dim
light. It is Gandalf, armed with sword and staff.
ANGLE ON: Slowly, the dwarves and the goblins recover from
the shockwave. All eyes turn to Gandalf.
[Gandalf:]
Take up arms. Fight. Fight!
The dwarves jump to their feet, fending off the goblins.
Gandalf slices through the oncoming goblins like butter. The
Great Goblin points to Gandalf's sword, TREMBLING.
GREAT GOBLIN
He wields the Foe-Hammer. The
Beater, bright as daylight!
The dwarves manage to reach their weapons. AXES, SWORDS, and
HAMMERS are tossed from this dwarf to that dwarf. Together,
they charge into battle, SHOUTING WAR CRIES.
Kili slices through goblins, spraying BLACK BLOOD. They fall
to his feet, dead. In his haste, Kili trips over the bodies

The Great Goblin rises to his feet. He charges forward,
bringing his mace down on Kili. Thorin intervenes,
deflecting the Great Goblin's blow.
With a FRIGHTENED HOWL, the Great Goblin falls backwards and
off of the platform. He goes sailing down into the abyss
below, SCREAMING LIKE A COWARD.

Gollum SHOUTS from the distance.

Bilbo dives into a cave on his left, PANTING. He sees Gollum
crawl past the entrance. Relieved, Bilbo makes for a crack
in the cave wall.
He squeezes through the cranny. However, his SHIRT BUTTONS
catch along the edges. He is stuck.
From outside, Gollum backtracks. He locks eyes with Bilbo.
He SNARLS, and rushes into the cave.
[Gollum:] (CONT'D)
It's ours! It's ours!
Bilbo exhales and pushes as hard as he can.
CLOSE ON: He manages to fit through the crack, but his brass

onto his finger, casting him INVISIBLE.
ANGLE ON: Now in the RING WORLD, Bilbo watches as Gollum
leaps into the cave. Gollum looks around for Bilbo,
confused.
In Bilbo's state of vision, everything is BLURRED and
COLORLESS.
[Gollum:] (CONT'D)
Thief! Baggins!
As Gollum ROARS, the sound seems to be COMPRESSED. He darts
off, going deeper into the tunnels. Bilbo gets to his feet,
amazed.
93 INT. TUNNEL EXIT - MISTY MOUNTAINS - DAY 93
WIDE ON: Gollum leaps into the final tunnel. Light is seen
through the exit of the cave. SUNRISE.
[Gollum:]
Wait, my precious! Wait! Gollum,
Gollum.
ANGLE ON: Still invisible, Bilbo approaches Gollum, sword
drawn. He watches as Gollum peers out of the tunnel exit,
distressed.
Suddenly, SHUFFLING FOOSTEPS sound from nearby. Gollum
rushes back into the tunnel, and hides out of sight. The
FOOTSTEPS come closer, and closer, until -
It is Gandalf. He leads the dwarves out of the tunnel,
urgently BARKING COMMANDS. Bilbo watches them, FRANTIC.
94 EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - WILDERLAND - DAY 94
CRANE SHOT: Gandalf and the seven dwarves rush down the vast
mountainside. Sunlight is slowly CREEPING over top of the
trees.
95 INT. TUNNEL EXIT - MISTY MOUNTAINS - DAY 95
CLOSE ON: Gollum turns, looking back at the exit. Bilbo
stands behind him. He draws his sword, raising it high above
Gollum's head.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 96.
95 CONTINUED: 95
Gollum turns back around. Although he cannot see him, Gollum
stares straight at Bilbo. Bilbo grips his sword, hesitating.
SALTY TEARS begin to well in Gollum's eyes. For a second, he
seems almost human.
Out of pity, Bilbo lowers his sword. He takes a DEEP BREATH,
and steps back. Gollum begins to SNARL, hearing him. Bilbo
runs forward and leaps over Gollum, knocking him down in the
process.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo flees out of the exit, into the daylight.
CLOSE ON: Enraged, Gollum jumps to his feet. He scrabbles
around himself, grabbing for Bilbo.
[Gollum:]
Baggins! Thief! Curse it and crush
it, we hates it forever!
96 EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - WILDERLAND - DAY 96
CRANE SHOT: Still invisible, Bilbo bolts down the
mountainside, hot on the dwarves' trail.
WIDE ON: Far ahead of Bilbo, Gandalf stops to count the
dwarves as they catch up.
[Gandalf:]
Three, four, five, Gloin, that's
six. And Dwalin, that makes seven.
Gandalf looks around him for Bilbo.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
Where's Bilbo? Where is our hobbit?
None of the dwarves answer.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo has caught up with the others. He stands
behind a tree, LISTENING.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
Where is our hobbit?
[Dwalin:]
Curse the halfling! Now he's lost!
[Gloin:]
I thought he was with Kili!
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 97.
96 CONTINUED: 96
[Kili:]
Don't blame me!
[Gandalf:]
Well, where did you last see him?
[Oin:]
I think I saw him slip away when
they fist cornered us.
Gandalf becomes greatly discontent. Almost panicked.
[Gandalf:]
What happened exactly? Tell me!
[Thorin:]
I'll tell you what happened. Master
Baggins saw his chance and he took
it. He's thought of nothing but his
soft bed and his warm hearth since
first he stepped out of his door.
We will not be seeing our hobbit
again. He is long gone.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo leans against the tree, seemingly CRUSHED.
The dwarves look at one another, indifferent.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo, NOW VISIBLE, steps out from behind the
tree.
[Bilbo:]
No, he isn't.
The dwarves look surprised. Gandalf's face lights up in
relief.
[Gandalf:]
Bilbo Baggins! I've never been so
glad to see anyone in my life!
Bilbo steps closer. The dwarves circle around him, stunned.
[Kili:]
Bilbo! We'd given you up!
[Fili:]
How on earth did you get past the
goblins?
[Dwalin:]
How, indeed.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 98.
96 CONTINUED: (2) 96
Bilbo gives a NERVOUS LAUGH as he slips the Ring into his
pocket. Gandalf notices, but says nothing.
[Gandalf:]
Well, what does it matter? He's
back.
[Thorin:]
It matters. I want to know; why did
you come back?
[Bilbo:]
Look, I know you doubt me. I know
you always have. And you're right.
I often think of Bag End. I miss my
books, and my armchair, and my
garden. See, that's where I belong.
That's home. And you don't have
one, a home. It was taken from you.
But I will help you take it back if
I can.
CLOSE ON: The dwarves are taken aback. Slowly, it dawns on
them: Bilbo cares. Gandalf, impressed, shares a warm smile
with the hobbit.
97 EXT. CLIFFSIDE - WILDERLAND - DAY 97
ANGLE ON: Looming above the dwarves, a TROOP OF ORCS ride to
the edge of the cliff. At the head of the pack rides BOLG OF
THE NORTH.
Half blind, muscular and tall, Bolg looks to be a force to
be reckoned with. He turns to the Orcs behind him, pointing
forward.
BOLG
(in Black Speech;
subtitled)
Run them down! Tear them to pieces!
At his call, his troop races down the cliffside, mounted on
JET BLACK WARGS.
98 EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - WILDERLAND - DAY 98
WIDE ON: The dwarves jump up, hearing the HOWLS. Thorin
looks to Gandalf, wide eyed.
[Thorin:]
Out of the frying pan -
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 99.
98 CONTINUED: 98
[Gandalf:]
And into the fire. Run. Run!
Gandalf wheels around, leading Bilbo and the dwarves down
the face of the mountain. Bolg and his riders chase after
them.
99 EXT. PLAINS - WILDERLAND - DAY 99
ANGLE ON: The Company darts across GRASSLANDS and STREAMS.
Gandalf leads the way, yards ahead of the dwarves.
[Gandalf:]
Come on!
100 EXT. FOREST - WILDERLAND - DAY 100
WIDE ON: Bolg and his orcs speed through the THICK TREES,
weapons drawn. Suddenly, an EAR SPLITTING ROAR rings through
the forest.
ANGLE ON: The orc pack skids to a halt, looking for the
noise.
Further along, the dwarves come to a stop. The look in
dismay at one another.
[Gandalf:]
This way, quickly!
Gandalf resumes his run. With haste, Bilbo and the dwarves
follow after him.
101 EXT. PLAINS - WILDERLAND - DAY 101
WIDE ON: Gandalf points forward. A LARGE, WOODEN HOUSE
surrounded by TREES and HEDGES is seen in the distance.
[Gandalf:]
To the house! Run!
The ROARING ECHOS from behind them. The dwarves run a little
faster, drawing nearer and nearer to the house.
102 EXT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - DAY 102
CRANE SHOT: Eventually, the Company reaches the house. They
sprint through a GATE between the hedges.
[Gandalf:]
Come on, get inside!
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 100.
102 CONTINUED: 102
ANGLE ON: The dwarves rush to the door, BUMBLEBEES BUZZING
past them. They reach the door, throwing themselves against
it in desperation.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf looks as a MASSIVE BEAR breaks out from
the edge of the forest and barrels towards them.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
Open the door!
Thorin pushes through the dwarves. He manages to raise the
EXTERIOR BOLT, opening the doors. As the bear crashes
through the gate, the entire company floods into the home.
103 INT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - DAY 103
The dwarves attempt to slam the door shut. However, the bear
pushes his head inside, ROARING and SNARLING.
Panicked, the dwarves push against the door, SCREAMING.
Bilbo withdraws his sword and points it up at the bear.
Gandalf only watches, calm.
With a final heave, the dwarves manage to close the door and
drop the bolt across it. Catching their breath, everyone
looks to Gandalf.
[Bilbo:]
What is that?
[Gandalf:]
That is our host. His name is Beorn
and he's a skinchanger. Sometimes
he's a huge, black bear, sometimes
he's a great, strong man. The bear
is unpredictable, but the man can
be reasoned with. However, he is
not overfond of dwarves.
The dwarves look at one another, distressed. Bilbo peaks
through a crack in the door.
[Bilbo:]
He's leaving.
Fili steps forward. He places a hand on Bilbo's shoulder.
[Fili:]
Get away from there. It's not
natural, none of it. He's under
some dark spell.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 101.
103 CONTINUED: 103
[Gandalf:]
Don't be ridiculous. He's under no
enchantment but his own.
(he turns to the others)
Alright now, get some rest, all of
you. You'll be safe here tonight.
ANGLE ON: The dwarves begin to spread through the house.
104 INT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - NIGHT 104
Most of the dwarves sleep throughout the house, peaceful and
at ease. Thorin sits beside a window, looking out at the
VAST FIELDS. Gandalf sits among the resting dwarves, smoking
his pipe.
Bilbo and Balin are seated at the kitchen table, staring
into the CRACKLING FLAMES.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo turns to Balin, confused.
[Bilbo:]
Balin, who was that out there? The
orc?
[Balin:]
Bolg of the North. An ancient enemy
of Durin's Folk.
[Bilbo:]
Ancient enemy. That's why he's
chasing us?
[Balin:]
Aye. After the dragon took the
Lonely Mountain, Thorin's
grandfather, King Thror, tried to
reclaim the ancient dwarf kingdom
of Moria.
105 EXT. MORIA GATES - MISTY MOUNTAINS - DAY (FLASHBACK) 105
WIDE ON: THOUSANDS OF DWARVES fight THOUSANDS OF ORCS before
the great gates of Moria. YOUNGER VERSIONS of Thorin, Balin
and Dwalin fight alongside THRAIN, Thorin's father, and the
great KING THROR.
[Balin:] (V.O.)
But our enemy had gotten there
first.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 102.
105 CONTINUED: 105
Bodies drop left and right. Fatal blows are dealt to both
armies. With one fall of their swords, Thorin, Thrain and
Thror fight off the orcs with great skill.
Amongst the carnage, a pale-white orc looms over the armies,
SCARS strewn across his bare chest. AZOG THE DEFILER.
He gives a MIGHTY ROAR, wiping out dwarves with his MASSIVE
MACE.
[Balin:] (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Moria had been taken by legions of
orcs led by the most vile of all
their race. Bolg's father, Azog the
Defiler. The giant Gunabad Orc had
sworn to wipe out the line of
Durin.
CLOSE ON: Azog spots Thror in the battlefield and lumbers
forward. The dwarven king looks small and weak compared to
his colossal enemy.
106 INT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - NIGHT 106
Thorin listens from the window as he stares into the wild.
Bilbo listen eagerly from the table.
[Balin:]
He began by beheading the king.
Tears well in Balin's eyes, REMEMBERING.
107 EXT. MORIA GATES - MISTY MOUNTAINS - DAY (FLASHBACK) 107
WIDE ON: Azog ROARS IN TRIUMPH. He holds King Thror's
SEVERED HEAD high above him for all to see.
CLOSE ON: Azog flings the head forward. It bounces and
tumbles down the rocky earth, landing directly at Thorin's
feet.
[Thorin:]
NO!
108 INT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - NIGHT 108
Gandalf's pipe drops from his mouth. He is disturbed by this
tale, even though he has heard it before.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 103.
108 CONTINUED: 108
[Balin:]
Thrain, Thorin's father, was driven
mad by grief. He went missing,
taken prisoner or killed. We do not
know.
Thorin has a pained look about his face as Balin presses on.
109 EXT. MORIA GATES - MISTY MOUNTAINS - DAY (FLASHBACK) 109
WIDE ON: Rank upon rank of orc armies massacre the dwarves.
Their bodies fall from the cliffs around Moria. A MORBID
WATERFALL.
[Balin:] (V.O.)
We were leaderless. Defeat and
death were upon us.
Dwarves begin to flee the battleground. The orcs have the
upper hand.
110 INT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - NIGHT 110
CLOSE ON: Balin looks to Thorin, still facing the window.
His face glows with pride. The dwarves begin to STIR from
the ground.
[Balin:]
That is when I saw him. The young
dwarf prince facing down the Pale
Orc.
111 EXT. MORIA GATES - MISTY MOUNTAINS - DAY (FLASHBACK) 111
ANGLE ON: Thorin marches toward Azog, ready for battle. He
is armed with SWORD AND SHIELD, a FINE PLATE OF ARMOR
protecting him.
[Balin:] (V.O.)
He stood alone against this
terrible foe.
Azog swings his mace, knocking away Thorin's shield. Thorin
hacks at Azog, but with another swing of the mace, he finds
his sword flying out of his hands as well.
The force of the blow causes Thorin to fall backwards. Azog
makes his way towards him, GOING IN FOR THE KILL. Just then,
Thorin grabs a near OAKEN BRANCH, dodging at Azog's swing.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 104.
111 CONTINUED: 111
Thorin gets to his feet again, blocking every fall of Azog's
mace with his branch.
[Balin:] (V.O.) (CONT'D)
His armor rent, he wielded nothing
but an oaken branch as a shield.
CLOSE ON: A powerful swing sends Thorin to the ground once
again. Azog looms over Thorin, ready to kill. A fallen sword
lies beside Thorin. Quickly, he picks up the weapon and
rises.
ANGLE ON: Thorin charges forward, his sword meeting with
Azog's mace. Determined, Thorin checks a blow against Azog.
The orc stumbles backwards. He swings his sword, slicing off
Azog's head. Thorin has cut the head off the snake.
[Balin:] (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Azog the Defiler learned that day
that the Line of Durin could not be
so easily broken. From that day
forth, Bolg had sworn to avenge his
father.
WIDE ON: Thorin raises Azog's head above his own, SHOUTING
WAR CRIES. Bolg looks on from the battleground, enraged.
Thorin rallies his men, charging against their enemies with
savage force. The remaining orcs are wiped out.
[Balin:] (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Our forces rallied and drove the
orcs back. Our enemy had been
defeated.
CROSSFADE:
112 EXT. MORIA GATES - MISTY MOUNTAINS - DAY - LATER (FLASHBACK) 112
The empty battlefield is covered in the corpses of dwarves
and orcs alike.
CLOSE ON: The surviving dwarves weep with one another over
their losses.
[Balin:] (V.O.)
But there was no feast nor song
that night, for our dead were
beyond the count of grief. We few
had survived.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 105.
112 CONTINUED: 112
Balin, battle-scarred and weeping, looks up at the field. He
spots Thorin striding across the battleground, his oaken
branch in hand.
[Balin:] (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And I thought to myself then: there
is one who I could follow. There is
one I could call king.
113 INT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - NIGHT 113
Thorin turns away from the window, visibly moved. All of the
dwarves have woken and are standing in awe before Thorin. A
warm smile splits across Balin's face.
Bilbo still seems befuddled.
[Bilbo:]
But Bolg of the North, he's still
out there.
Thorin steps closer to Bilbo, swollen in his pride.
[Thorin:]
Aye. But we'll be waiting for him.
Gandalf and Thorin exchange glances. A hint of doubt lies
under Gandalf's smile.
114 EXT. FOREST - WILDERLAND - NIGHT 114
ANGLE ON: Bolg and his company watch the house from a
distance. Beorn, in his bear form, circles around the house,
GROWLING. Yazneg approaches Bolg.
YAZENG
(in Black Speech;
subtitled)
Attack them now. Kill the dwarf
filth while they sleep.
BOLG
(in Black Speech;
subtitled)
No. The Beast stands guard. We will
kill them on the road.
Bolg turns, looking towards his WARGS.
WIDE ON: He and his orcs mount the fierce beasts and ride
off into the distance. Beorn ambles after them. The bear
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 106.
114 CONTINUED: 114
stumbles over.
Slowly, HIS FORM MELTS into that of a TALL MAN. He rises to
his feet, staring to his house in the distance.
115 INT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - NIGHT 115
ANGLE ON: Everyone is asleep. Suddenly, there is a RUSTLING
NOISE. Bilbo wakes, quietly peeking out of his BLANKETS. He
sees Beorn enter the house. With a SIGH, Beorn closes the
door behind him.
116 EXT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - DAY 116
CLOSE ON: PONIES prance through the field, their manes
fluttering in the wind
117 INT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - DAY 117
A very large BUMBLEBEE lands on Bilbo's nose. He wakes with
a start. The bee flies off, alarmed.
WIDE ON: Quickly, Bilbo puts on his jacket and walks towards
the kitchen. Gandalf and the dwarves are all gathered there,
with Beorn looming over them.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo sits down at the table. Beorn pours a GLASS
OF MILK for Fili, locking eyes with Thorin.
[Beorn:]
So you are the one they call
Oakenshield? Tell me, why is Bolg
of the North hunting you?
[Thorin:]
You know of Bolg? How?
[Beorn:]
My people were the first to live in
the mountains, before the orcs came
down from the north. Bolg and his
father Azog killed most of my
family, but some he enslaved. Not
for work, you understand, but for
sport. Caging skin-changers and
torturing them seemed to amuse him.
Bilbo notices the remnants of MANACLES around Beorn's wrist.
[Bilbo:]
There are others like you?
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 107.
117 CONTINUED: 117
[Beorn:]
Once there were many.
[Bilbo:]
And now?
[Beorn:]
Now there is only one.
WIDE ON: Beorn sets down the MILK PITCHER. The dwarves look
on in silence.
[Beorn:] (CONT'D)
You need to reach the mountain
before the last days of autumn?
[Gandalf:]
Before Durin's Day falls, yes.
[Beorn:]
You are running out of time.
[Gandalf:]
Which is why we must go through
Mirkwood.
[Beorn:]
A darkness lies upon that forest.
Fell things creep beneath those
trees. I would not venture there
except in great need.
[Gandalf:]
We will take the Elven Road. That
path is still safe.
[Beorn:]
Safe? The Wood-Elves of Mirkwood
are not like their kin. They're
less wise and more dangerous. But
it matters not.
CLOSE ON: Thorin looks troubled.
[Thorin:]
What do you mean?
[Beorn:]
These lands are crawling with orcs.
Their numbers are growing, and you

[Beorn:] (cont'd)
are on foot. You will never reach
the forest alive.
ANGLE ON: Beorn rises from the table. He glares down at
Thorin.
[Beorn:] (CONT'D)
I don't like dwarves. They're
greedy and blind, blind to the
lives they deem lesser than their
own.
CLOSE ON: Beorn picks up a SCAMPERING MOUSE from the table.
The dwarves watch, nervous. Beorn pets the creature.
[Beorn:] (CONT'D)
But orcs I hate more. What do you
need?
Thorin looks relieved.
118 EXT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - DAY 118
ANGLE ON: The dwarves pack their things onto Beorn's ponies.
Near the edge of the hedges, Bilbo rummages through the
dirt. He picks up an ACORN and slips it in his pocket.
Gandalf and Beorn stand further back, watching the dwarves
mount up.
[Beorn:]
You will leave my ponies before you
enter the forest.
[Gandalf:]
You have my word.
BIRDS CAW in the distance. Gandalf looks up in suspicion.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
We're being watched.
[Beorn:]
Yes. The orcs will not give up.
They will hunt the dwarves until
they seem them destroyed.
[Gandalf:]
Why now? What has made Bolg crawl
from his hole?
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 109.
118 CONTINUED: 118
[Beorn:]
There is an alliance between the
orcs of Moria and the sorcerer in
Dol Guldur.
[Gandalf:]
Are you sure of this?
[Beorn:]
Packs have been seen gathering
there. Each day, more and more
come.
CLOSE ON: A distant ORC SCREAM sounds from the woods. The
dwarves perk up in alarm.
[Gandalf:]
What do you know of this sorcerer,
the one they call the Necromancer?
[Beorn:]
I know he is not what he seems.
Fell things are drawn to his power.
Bolg pays homage to him.
[Thorin:]
Gandalf, time is wasting.
ANGLE ON: With a nod, Gandalf marches forward.
[Beorn:]
There is more.
Gandalf stops in his tracks.
[Beorn:] (CONT'D)
Not long past, word spread that the
dead had been seen walking near the
High Fells of Rhudaur.
[Gandalf:]
The dead?
[Beorn:]
Is it true? Are there tombs in
those mountains?
[Gandalf:]
Yes. Yes, there are tombs up there.
CLOSE ON: Beorn seems slightly taken aback.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 110.
118 CONTINUED: (2) 118
[Beorn:]
I remember a time when a great evil
ruled these lands. One powerful
enough to raise the dead. If that
enemy has returned to Middle Earth,
I would have you tell me.
[Gandalf:]
Saruman the White says it is not
possible. The enemy is destroyed
and will never return.
[Beorn:]
And what does Gandalf the Grey
think?
Gandalf STUTTERS, trying to think of what to say. Suddenly,
another LOUD CAW echoes across the grasslands.
[Beorn:] (CONT'D)
Go now, while you have the light.
Your hunters are not far behind.
ANGLE ON: As Gandalf mounts his pony, a WARG HOWLS. Beorn
stands alone, watching the Company ride off into the
distance.
119 EXT. ELVEN GATE - MIRKWOOD - DAY 119
WIDE ON: The Company rides rapidly across the lands. They
stop before a gloomy, forboding forest. MIRKWOOD.
ANGLE ON: Gandalf walks into the edge of the forest, passing
underneath an ANCIENT ARCHWAY.
[Gandalf:]
The Elven Gate.
He turns to address the dwarves.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
Here lies our path through
Mirkwood.
[Dwalin:]
No sign of the orcs, we have luck
on our side.
Gandalf looks doubtful.

WIDE ON: From a distant ridge, Beorn stands watch over them,
in his bear form.
[Gandalf:]
Set the ponies loose. Let them
return to their master.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo and the dwarves begin to dismount and
unsaddle their ponies. Bilbo approaches the forest.
[Bilbo:]
This forest feels sick, as if a
disease lies upon it. Is there no
way around?
[Gandalf:]
Not if we go two hundred miles
north, or twice that distance
south.
Gandalf goes deeper into the forest and comes across an IVY
COVERED STATUE. From outside the gate, Bilbo fiddles with
the Ring in his pocket.
IMAGE: Galadriel stands in Rivendell, observing the sunrise.
[Galadriel:] (V.O.)
Something moves in the shadows,
unseen, hidden from our sight.
Every day it grows in strength.
Beware the Necromancer. He is not
what he seems.
CLOSE ON: From the gate, Bilbo continues to play with the
Ring.
IMAGE: The EYE OF SAURON flickers onto the screen.
CLOSE ON: Startled, Bilbo takes his hand out of his pockets.
Gandalf yanks back the vines, revealing the Eye of Sauron
PAINTED onto the statue. The wizard stumbles back in shock.
[Galadriel:] (V.O.) (CONT'D)
If our enemy has returned, we must
know. Go to the tombs in the
mountain.
The wizard nods in agreement.

The High Fells. So be it.
WIDE ON: The unladen ponies trot away from the Elven Gate.
Gloin is nearly finished unsaddling Gandalf's horse when he
emerges from the forest.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
Not my horse! I need it!
CLOSE ON: As Gandalf strides forward, Bilbo and the dwarves
look up in surprise.
[Bilbo:]
You're not leaving us?
[Gandalf:]
I would not do this unless I had
to.
Thorin looks deeply displeased. Gandalf stops next to Bilbo,
looking down at him with suspicion.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
You've changed, Bilbo Baggins.
You're not the same hobbit as the
one who left the Shire.
[Bilbo:]
I was going to tell you -
(beat)
I found something in the Goblin
Tunnels.
[Gandalf:]
Found what?
Gandalf leans forward, curious. Bilbo looks up at him,
STUTTERING as he fumbles with the Ring in his pocket.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
What did you find?
Bilbo removes his hand from his pocket.
[Bilbo:]
My courage.
[Gandalf:]
Good. Well, that's good; you'll
need it.

119 CONTINUED: (3) 119
ANGLE ON: Gandalf turns and begins to mount his horse.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
I'll be waiting for you at the
overlook before the slopes of
Erebor. Keep the map and key safe.
Do not enter that mountain without
me. This is not the Greenwood of
old. The very air of the forest is
heavy with illusion. It will seek
to enter your mind and lead you
astray.
Confused, Bilbo turns to the dwarves surrounding.
[Bilbo:]
Lead us astray? What does that
mean?
A LIGHT RAIN begins to come down from the skies.
[Gandalf:]
You must stay on the path; do not
leave it. If you do, you will never
find it again.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf climbs on top of his horse's SADDLE. He
gives the dwarves one last glance, before he rides into the
forest.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
No matter what may come, you must
stay on the path!
ANGLE ON: Thorin watches him leave. He turns, and leads the
company into the forest.
[Thorin:]
Come on. We must reach the mountain
before the sun sets on Durin's Day.
This is our one chance to find the
hidden door.
CRANE SHOT: The Company files into Mirkwood. PANNING UP, we
see an endless field of DARK, GLOOMY TREES spanning the
horizon.
120 EXT. ELVEN PATH - MIRKWOOD - DAY 120
ANGLE ON: The Company follows the ELVEN PATH. At one point,
Thorin brushes aside some LEAVES to see that the stones

round a corner.
[Thorin:]
The path turns this way.
Bilbo and the dwarves follow at his word.
IMAGES: The path twists and turns throughout the forest,
leading across BARE GROUND, HIGH LEDGES, and FALLEN TREE
TRUNKS.
IMAGE: Further along, Dwalin thumps his hammer onto the
ground. The metal CLUNCKS against the stone path.
[Dwalin:]
This way.
IMAGE: As the dwarves press on, they become further and
further DISORIENTATED.
[Oin:]
Air, I need air. My head, it's
swimming.
Oin looks above him. FIREFLIES flutter around his head.
Perplexed, Oin turns back to the path ahead.
121 EXT. STONE BRIDGE - MIRKWOOD - DAY 121
ANGLE ON: The dwarves cross a STONE BRIDGE leading over a
MURKY STREAM. Bilbo is the first to reach the other side.
CLOSE ON: Exhausted, Bilbo takes a seat. Thorin, holding a
BOW AND ARROW, jumps down from the bridge. He lands beside a
startled Bilbo.
Suddenly, there is a RUSTLING NOISE from the trees.
Bilbo rises, as he sees a WHITE STAG TROT into a clearing.
It SHIMMERS against the gloomy forest backdrop, like a
beacon of hope.
From beside him, Thorin slowly DRAWS HIS BOW.
[Bilbo:]
What are you doing?
Thorin and the stag locks eyes. For a moment, he seems to
hesitate.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 115.
121 CONTINUED: 121
WIDE ON: He FIRES THE ARROW nonetheless. It misses, sending
the stag running off into the woods.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
You shouldn't have done that. It's
bad luck.
CLOSE ON: Thorin shakes his head, oddly enraged.
[Thorin:]
I don't believe in luck. We make
our own luck.
122 EXT. MIRKWOOD - NIGHT 122
WIDE ON: Darkness settles in between the Mirkwood trees. The
dwarves wander the forest, aimless and exhausted.
ANGLE ON: Gloin stamps the end of his axe against the
ground. There is no sound of metal on stone.
[Kili:]
We need to take a rest.
Thorin nods in agreement, disorientated. The dwarves stop to
catch their breath. Bilbo sits beside a CLUMP OF SPIDERWEBS.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo perks up in alarm. STRANGE WHISPERS echo
around the forest.
[Bilbo:]
What is that? Those voices, can you
hear them?
[Thorin:]
I hear nothing. No wind, no birds.
He stares up at the ROOF OF LEAVES, glowing blue in the
moonlight.
[Thorin:] (CONT'D)
What hour is it?
[Dwalin:]
I do not know. I don't even know
what day it is.
[Thorin:]
This is taking too long. Too long!
Is there no end to this accursed
forest?
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 116.
122 CONTINUED: 122
[Gloin:]
None that I can see. Only trees and
more trees!
Gloin looks around him, strangely panicked.
ANGLE ON: Thorin slowly walks forward, seeing something.
[Thorin:]
There! This way!
[Oin:]
But Gandalf said -
[Thorin:]
Do as I say; follow me!
The dwarves trudge forward.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo still sits beside the webs, hearing the
voices. He absentmindedly PLUCKS the webs, which VIBRATES.
The vibrations carry onto other linked webs, leading off
into the forest. Bilbo looks up, troubled.
ANGLE ON: He rises, pointing to the Elven Path behind him.
[Bilbo:]
Wait! Stop! We can't leave the
path! We must stay on the path!
No one answers.
123 EXT. MIRKWOOD - DAY 123
CLOSE ON: Bilbo and the dwarves stumble forward. Bilbo looks
down, and sees his feet WALK BACKWARDS. He looks back up,
bewildered.
Bilbo turns to Gloin walking behind him. He sees HIMSELF
staring back at him. Even more confused, Bilbo turns back
around him. He continues down the forest, his vision TILTING
and SHIFTING.
ANGLE ON: Gloin leans down and picks up a TOBACCO POUCH.
[Gloin:]
Look. A tobacco pouch. There's
dwarves in these woods.
Fili takes the pouch from Gloin. He looks surprised.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 117.
123 CONTINUED: 123
[Fili:]
Dwarves from the Blue Mountains, no
less. This one is exactly the same
as mine.
[Bilbo:]
Because it is yours. You
understand? We're going around in
circles. We are lost!
[Dwalin:]
We're not lost. We keep heading
east.
[Oin:]
But which way is east? We've lost
the sun!
The dwarves begin to BICKER INDISTINCTLY.
HIGH ANGLE: Bilbo peers up at the leaves above. A bit of
sunlight creeps through the tree canopy far above him.
[Bilbo:]
The sun. We have to find the sun.
Up there! We need to -
ANGLE ON: He turns to the dwarves. They begin to PUSH and
SHOVE one another. Thorin stands away from the others,
listening. He hears LOW WHISPERING.
[Thorin:]
What was that?
(turns to the others)
Quiet, all of you! We're being
watched.
Bilbo begins to climb the CROOKED TREES. Around him, masses
of spiderwebs are interwoven through the forest.
124 EXT. TREETOPS - MIRKWOOD - DAY 124
WIDE ON: Bilbo pops out of the MULTICOLORED TREETOPS of
Mirkwood. His head clears, as if a spell has been broken.
Bilbo LAUGHS, relieved, as BLUE BUTTERFLIES flutter around
him.
In the distance, he sees RIVERS and LAKES.
[Bilbo:]
I can see a lake! And a river.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 118.
124 CONTINUED: 124
He spots something on the horizon. THE LONELY MOUNTAIN.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
And the Lonely Mountain! We're
almost there! Can you hear me? I
know which way to go!
The dwarves do not reply.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
Hello?
From below, he can hear TREES CRACKING. The treetops RUSTLE,
as if something is approaching. Worried, Bilbo creeps below
the treeline.
125 EXT. MIRKWOOD - DAY 125
ANGLE ON: Bilbo peers below him. He steps forward, and his
feet catch on a SPIDERWEB. Bilbo falls downward, bouncing
off SEVERAL BRANCHES, SCREAMING all the while.
He lands on another branch, catching his breath. He watches
in horror as the webs part, revealing a GINORMOUS SPIDER. It
opens its fangs and HISSES, sending Bilbo to fall backwards
onto a MASSIVE SPIDERWEB.
The spider CRAWLS forward, quickly wrapping Bilbo up inside
the web.
126 EXT. MIRKWOOD - DAY - LATER 126
CLOSE ON: Wrapped up in webs, the dwarves dangle down from
tree branches. Several LARGE SPIDERS creep around them,
whispering to each other.
ANGLE ON: One particular spider tows a web-encased Bilbo
towards the dwarves. As the spider feels him up, Bilbo
slowly begins to awake. He looks up through the webs,
startled.
Bilbo manages to swing his sword, cutting through both the
web and the spider. The creature HOWLS IN PAIN, staggering
backwards. It goes flying off of the branch, dead.
Bilbo rips off the web cocoon and rises. He sees the dwarves
and the spiders surrounding them. Carefully, Bilbo creeps
behind a tree trunk and slips on his Ring.
CLOSE ON: He is transported into the blurry Ring World once
again. The spiders' whispering ECHOES around him.

SPIDER #1
Kill them, kill them now!
SPIDER #2
Eat them now, wet and runny!
SPIDER #3
Their hide is tough! There's good
juice inside!
SPIDER #1
Stick it again! Stick it again!
Finish it off!
ANGLE ON: The spiders approach Gloin, wrapped in his own
web-cacoon. He springs to life, kicking against the GLOSSY
WEBS. He can't do much.
SPIDER #4
Ah! The meat's alive and kicking!
SPIDER #1
Kill them now! Kill them now!
SPIDER #2
Feast! Feast! Feast!
All of the spiders take up the chant, circling around the
dwarf. Bilbo steps forward, and grabs a PIECE OF WOOD from
the trees.
He throws it into the woods below. The spiders perk up,
distracted. They all rush together towards the source of the
noise.
SPIDER #3
What is it? What is it? Kill it!
Feast!
One spider stays behind, preparing to eat Gloin. The dwarf
KICKS and WAILS against the spider.
SPIDER #2
Fat and juicy! Just a little taste!
Invisible, Bilbo sneaks up and strikes his sword against the
spider's rear. The spider spins around and HISSES, but Bilbo
still hacks away at the creature.
SPIDER #2 (CONT'D)
Curses! Where is it? Where is it?

CLOSE ON: With a grin, Bilbo slips off the Ring.
[Bilbo:]
Here.
Bilbo drives his sword into the spider's head. It WHIMPERS.
SPIDER #2
It stings! Stings! Stings!
ANGLE ON: Bilbo pulls out his sword, sending the spider
crashing to the ground. Bilbo examines his sword.
[Bilbo:]
Sting. That's a good name.
He looks to where the other dwarves are wrapped up.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
Sting.
Bilbo walks forward, using Sting to cut down the dwarves
from their branches.
CLOSE ON: They land on the forest floor, and proceed to rip
off their wrappings, CURSING and YELLING. Fili emerges from
his cacoon, PANICKED.
[Fili:]
Where's Bilbo?
Bilbo peers down at the dwarves, waving.
[Bilbo:]
I'm up here!
Suddenly, a spider jumps at Bilbo from underneath the
branch.
ANGLE ON: The hobbit falls backwards, and the spider pins
him to the ground. Bilbo manage to raise his sword, and
stabs the spider through the belly.
The spider begins to fall off the branch. Entangled in its
legs, Bilbo falls with it, SCREAMING all the while. As they
fall, the Ring slips out of Bilbo's grasp.
He lands on the LEAF COVERED GROUND and begins to search for
the Ring, desperate.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 121.
126 CONTINUED: (3) 126
The dwarves begin to rush out of their web cacoons,
brandishing weapons. DOZENS OF SPIDERS approach the Company.
They HISS and SNARL as they creep forward.
The dwarves begin to hack away at the army of spiders. Left
and right, the dead fall to the ground. Oin is knocked to
the ground by one spider. It looms over him, ready to feast.
[Dwalin:]
Grab a leg!
Dwalin leads the others towards the spider. Each dwarf grabs
one or two legs and PULLS. The legs PLOP off of the spider's
body. Dismembered, the spider falls on top of Oin, dead.
CLOSE ON: Further off, Bilbo continues to search for the
Ring. He seems greatly distressed. Panicked.
[Bilbo:]
Where is it? Where is it? Where is
it?
He freezes. Slowly, Bilbo looks over his shoulder.
WIDE ON: The Ring lies on the nearby ground, unstained and
untarnished by the MUD and DIRT.
ANGLE ON: Relieved, Bilbo steps forward.
Suddenly, a SMALL, PALE SPIDER emerges from the ground. The
spider pushes the Ring aside as it crawls forward.
Bilbo looks at the spider, infuriated. He raises Sting high
above his head, and runs forward with a YELL.
He hacks and slashes away at the spider. The spider falls to
the ground, dead. Still, Bilbo slices away, berserk. He cuts
away legs, feelers, and more. Finally, he jumps and sends
the sword down into the spider's head.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo catches his breath, staring down at the
Ring. He picks it up, holding the Ring beside his face.
[Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
Mine.
Satisfied, Bilbo sits next to the dead spider. He examines
the Ring, turning it forwards and backwards in his hands.
Finally, what he has just done dawns on Bilbo. Disgusted,
Bilbo looks at the spiderwebs and gore covering him.

SHOUTING sounds from the distance.
ANGLE ON: The dwarves are killing off the last of the
spiders. Their swords rise and fall, slicing away legs and
digging into brains. Thorin pauses amongst the chaos,
looking up at the treetops.
Above them, a BLONDE ELF runs through the branches. He grabs
onto SPIDER SILK, sliding down to the ground. The elf lands
on the ground, sliding towards the dwarves. As he moves, he
kills the spiders around him.
Finally, the elf comes to a halt. He points an arrow at
Thorin, revealing him to be -
[Legolas:]
Do not think I won't kill you
dwarf. It would be my pleasure.
[Legolas:] GREENLEAF.
WIDE ON: DOZENS OF WOODLAND ELVES encircle the Company, bows
drawn. Legolas turns to the others.
[Legolas:] (CONT'D)
Search them!
ANGLE ON: The elves begin to riffle through the dwarves'
coats and pockets. One elf, TAURIEL, stands over Fili,
confiscating his MANY KNIVES.
CLOSE ON: Legolas pulls an AMULET from Gloin's beard.
[Gloin:]
Give it back! That's private!
Legolas sees a picture of a dwarf inside.
[Legolas:]
Who is this? Your brother?
[Gloin:]
That is my wife.
Legolas looks at the other picture. A picture of a dwarf
child.
[Legolas:]
And what is this horrid creature? A
goblin mutant?

[Gloin:]
That's my wee lad, Gimli.
Legolas raises his eyebrow in contempt. Tauriel steps
towards Legolas, carrying several of Fili's knives.
[Legolas:]
(in Elvish; subtitled)
Are the spiders dead?
TAURIEL
(in Elvish; subtitled)
Yes, but more will come. They're
growing bolder.
Legolas looks only vaguely troubled. An elf steps forward,
handing Legolas Thorin's sword, Orcrist.
[Legolas:]
(in Elvish; subtitled)
This is an ancient Elvish blade.
Forged by my kin.
(in the Common Tongue)
Where did you get this?
ANGLE ON: He points the sword towards Thorin.
[Thorin:]
It was given to me.
[Legolas:]
Not just a thief, but a liar as
well.
Legolas shouts a command to the other elves. They begin to
lead the dwarves out of the forest.
CLOSE ON: As they walk, Fili looks to Thorin, troubled.
[Fili:]
Where's Bilbo?
Thorin scans the forest. There is no sign of Bilbo.
127 EXT. GATES - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 127
WIDE ON: The dwarves are led over a bridge and through the
gates. Their CHAINS JINGLE as they walk into the WOODLAND
REALM.

Invisible, Bilbo rushes forward. Legolas pauses, looking
behind him. He sees nothing. He turns and walks into the
gate. The elf guard closes it behind him. Bilbo manages to
slip in at the last moment.
128 INT. WOODLAND REALM - DAY 128
WIDE ON: The dwarves are led through the wooden walkways of
the Woodland Realm. The entire place is built out of TREE
ROOTS in a SUBTERRANEAN CAVERN.
INTERCUT:
129 INT. THRONE ROOM - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 129
TEASING SHOTS: The Elvenking, THRANDUIL, sits on his wooden
throne. He stares, INTENSE, at the dwarves as they are led
into his kingdom.
130 INT. ELVEN CELLS - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 130
ANGLE ON: The dwarves are pushed into several cells. The
dwarves SHOUT AND PROTEST through the metal bars.
[Dwalin:]
This is not the end of it! Do you
hear me?
[Gloin:]
Let us out of here!
An elf inspects Fili once again, and finds another large
knife in his coat. Fili SIGHS IN FRUSTRATION as he is
dragged into his cell.
CLOSE ON: Fili watches from his cell. Tauriel begins to
close the door.
[Kili:]
Aren't you going to search me? I
could have anything down my
trousers.
TAURIEL
Or nothing.
She slams the door in his face.

ANGLE ON: The elves file out of the corridor.
Several dwarves begin to throw themselves against the cell
doors, GRUNTING in their effort. Balin shakes his head.
[Balin:]
Leave it! There's no way out! This
is no Orc dungeon; these are the
halls of the Woodland Realm. No one
leaves here but by the king's
consent.
Disappointed, the dwarves sit and sulk in their cells.
131 INT. THRONE ROOM - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 131
WIDE ON: Thorin stands before King Thranduil. The Elvenking
circle around the dwarf, glaring down at him.
THRANDUIL
Some may imagine that a noble quest
is at hand. A quest to reclaim a
homeland and slay a dragon. I
myself suspect a more prosaic
motive: attempted burglary, or
something of that ilk.
CLOSE ON: Thranduil looks closely at Thorin.
THRANDUIL (CONT'D)
You have found a way in. You seek
that which would bestow upon you
the right to rule: The King's
Jewel. The Arkenstone. It is
precious to you and your people
beyond measure. I understand that.
There are gems in the mountain that
I too desire. White gems of pure
starlight. I offer you my help.
[Thorin:]
I am listening.
THRANDUIL
I will let you go if you but return
what is mine.
ANGLE ON: Thorin begins to pace up and down the throne room.
He seems amused.

You have my word. One king to
another.
[Thorin:]
I would not trust Thranduil, the
great king, to honor his word,
should the end of all days be upon
us!
Enraged, Thorin spins around and points to Thranduil.
[Thorin:] (CONT'D)
You lack all honor! I have seen how
you treat your friends! We came to
you once, starving, homeless,
seeking your help, but you turned
your back. You turned away from the
suffering of my people and the
inferno that destroyed us!
(in Dwarvish)
Die a death of flames!
CLOSE ON: Infuriated, Thranduil leans forward. He and Thorin
are nose to nose.
THRANDUIL
Do not speak to me of dragon fire.
I know its wrath and ruin.
Suddenly, Thranduil's face contorts, revealing hidden BURNS
and SCARS. Thorin looks surprised.
THRANDUIL (CONT'D)
I have faced the great serpents of
the north.
ANGLE ON: He draws away, his face returning to normal.
THRANDUIL (CONT'D)
I warned your grandfather of what
his greed would summon, but he
would not listen. You are just like
him.
Thranduil motions to the guards. They begin to drag Thorin
away, as Thranduil returns to his throne.

the life of an elf. I am patient. I

132 INT. ELVEN CELLS - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 132
CLOSE ON: Thorin is thrown into a cell. The guards walk of
with a pair of JANGLING KEYS.
ANGLE ON: Balin rises in his cell across the hall.
[Balin:]
Did he offer you a deal?
[Thorin:]
I told him he could go die a death
of fire. Him and all his kin!
[Balin:]
Well, that's that then. The deal
was our only hope.
[Thorin:]
Not our only hope.
CLOSE ON: Thorin peers out of his cell, hopeful.
133 INT. THRANDUIL'S CHAMBERS - WOODLAND REALM - NIGHT 133
Bilbo, still invisible, peeks out behind a column. He steps
into the room. Thranduil steps out from a corner.
THRANDUIL
I know you're there. Why do you
linger in the shadows?
Bilbo freezes.
TAURIEL
I was coming to report to you.
ANGLE ON: Tauriel steps out of the staircase behind him.
Bilbo is greatly relieved.
THRANDUIL
I thought I ordered that nest to be
destroyed not two moons past.

TAURIEL
We cleared the forest as ordered,
my lord, but more spiders keep
coming up from the south. They are
spawning in the ruins of Dol
Guldur, if we could kill them at
their source.
THRANDUIL
That fortress lies beyond our
borders. Keep our lands clear of
those foul creatures, that is your
task.
TAURIEL
But will they not spread to other
lands?
THRANDUIL
Other lands are not my concern. The
fortunes of the world may rise and
fall, yet here in this kingdom, we
will endure.
Bilbo scuffles out of the chamber. Thranduil looks his way,
suspicious. Tauriel bows, and leaves Thranduil to himself.
134 INT. WINE CELLAR - WOODLAND REALM - NIGHT 134
Bilbo sneaks into the wine cellar. Elves are tying EMPTY
BARRELS together. ELROS approaches them, carrying a RING OF
DUNGEON KEYS in his hands.
ELROS
These empty barrels should have
been sent back to Esgaroth hours
ago. The bargeman will be waiting
for them.
A DRUNK ELF stumbles forward.
DRUNK ELF
Say what you like about our ill
tempered king and his excellent
taste in wine. Come, Elros, try it.
ELROS
I have the dwarves in my charge.

DRUNK ELF
They're locked up, where can they

The drunk elf takes the keys from Elros and hangs them on a
HOOK ON THE WALL. Bilbo takes note of the hanging keys.
135 EXT. HILLSIDE - RHUDAUR - DAY 135
WIDE ON: Gandalf carefully ventures up a STEEP HILLSIDE. In
the distance, STONE CLIFFS rise past the horizon.
136 EXT. CLIFFS - RHUDAUR - DAY 136
Gandalf climbs a narrow, stone STAIRCASE built into the side
of the tall, bare mountain. Just as he reaches a DOORWAY
carved into the rock, the step beneath him GIVES WAY.
Quickly, Gandalf catches himself and climbs onto the DOORWAY
entrance.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf holds onto a set of INTERLOCKING METAL
BARS bent away from the doorway. Long ago, they had covered
the entrance.
Cautious, Gandalf steps inside.
137 INT. HIGH FELLS - RHUDAUR - DAY 137
ANGLE ON: Suddenly, he is grabbed by some INVISIBLE FORCE
and pulled through a SHORT TUNNEL in the mountain.
He comes to a halt at the end of the tunnel, which leads
into a VAST and CAVERNOUS HOLLOW. Catching his breath,
Gandalf peers over the edge of the ledge. A DARK, EMPTY PIT
lies below, leading into some unknown darkness.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf cradles the top of his staff in his hand
and BLOWS. The staff begins to GLOW WHITE.
ANGLE ON: With this light, he examines his surroundings. On
the far wall, he sees METAL BARS torn away from another
doorway. The doorway of a CRYPT.
Slowly, he steps forward on NARROW STONES set in the side of
the cavern. He reaches the crypt doorway and steps inside.
138 INT. CRYPT - HIGH FELLS - DAY 138
CLOSE ON: Gandalf finds a CRUMBLED TOMB inside the ancient
crypt. Slowly, he approaches it, using the light of his

staff as a guide.
Suddenly, TWO BIRDS fly out of the broken tomb. Gandalf
gives a start, turning to look behind him. Radagast stands
at the crypt entrance.
[Gandalf:]
Oh, it's you!
[Radagast:]
Why am I here, Gandalf?
[Gandalf:]
Trust me, Radagast, I would not
have called you here without good
reason.
Radagast removes his hat, letting the birds settle into the
nest lying on top of his head. Radagast replaces the hat,
looking hard at the surrounding crypt.
[Radagast:]
This is not a nice place to meet.
[Gandalf:]
No, it is not.
139 INT. HIGH FELLS - RHUDAUR - DAY 139
ANGLE ON: Gandalf and Radagast step out of the crypt,
examining the RUNES surrounding the doorway.
[Radagast:]
These are dark spells, Gandalf; old
and full of hate. Who's burried
here?
[Gandalf:]
If he had a name, it's long since
been lost. He would have only been
known as a servant of evil. One of
a number. One of nine.
With his staff, Gandalf illuminates the cavern below. EIGHT
OTHER CRYPTS lie below, their metal bars BENT and BROKEN
AWAY.
140 EXT. HILLTOP - RHUDAUR - DAY 140
WIDE ON: Gandalf and Radagast rush down a HILLSIDE, urgent
in their business.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 131.
140 CONTINUED: 140
[Radagast:]
Why now, Gandalf? I don't
understand.
[Gandalf:]
The Ringwraiths have been summouned
to Dol Guldur.
[Radagast:]
But it cannot be the Necromancer. A
human sorcerer could not summon
such evil.
[Gandalf:]
Who said it was human?
ANGLE ON: Radagast stops abruptly.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
The Nine only answer to one master.
We've been blind, Radagast, and in
our blindness, the enemy has
returned.
CLOSE ON: Radagast looks shocked.
[Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
He is summoning his servants. Bolg
of the North is no ordinary hunter.
He is a commander, a commander of
legions. The enemy is preparing for
war. It will begin in the east. His
mind is set upon that mountain.
ANGLE ON: Gandalf turns and begins to walk down the hill.
Radagast follows behind him.
[Radagast:]
Where are you going?
[Gandalf:]
To rejoin the others!
[Radagast:]
Gandalf!
Gandalf looks back to Radagast, earnest.
[Gandalf:]
I started this; I cannot forsake
them. They are all in grave danger.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 132.
140 CONTINUED: (2) 140
[Radagast:]
If what you say is true, the world
is in grave danger. The power in
that fortress will only grow
stronger.
[Gandalf:]
You want me to cast my friends
aside?
CLOSE ON: Gandalf looks away, CONFLICTED.
141 INT. ELVEN CELLS - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 141
WIDE ON: Sunlight filters in through the prison corridor.
[Fili:]
I'll wager the sun is on the rise.
It must be nearly dawn.
CLOSE ON: Kili stands behind his cell door, looking
defeated.
[Kili:]
We're never going to reach the
mountain are we?
Bilbo emerges in front of the cell, holding up the ring of
keys.
[Bilbo:]
Not stuck in here you're not!
The other dwarves spring to their doors. They EXCLAIM in
surprise.
[Balin:]
Bilbo!
[Bilbo:]
Shush! There are guards nearby!
Bilbo unlocks Thorin's door. Thorin looks impressed as Bilbo
goes to the other cells and unlocks the rest of them.
ANGLE ON: The dwarves begin to walk up some stairs.
[Dwalin:]
The stairs! You first!
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 133.
141 CONTINUED: 141
[Bilbo:]
Not that way, down here. Follow me.
Bilbo leads the dwarves down another flight of stairs,
leading to the cellars.
142 INT. WINE CELLAR - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 142
CLOSE ON: Elros and the others SNORE from a table. FOOD is
scattered around the table, and GOBLETS OF WINE are clutched
in their hands.
The dwarves look in disbelief to Bilbo.
[Kili:]
I don't believe it; we're in the
cellars!
[Gloin:]
You're supposed to be leading us
out, not further in!
[Bilbo:]
I know what I'm doing. This way,
ANGLE ON: Bilbo points to the stack of barrels. They are all
OPENED.
143 INT. ELVEN CELLS - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 143
CLOSE ON: The elven guards open the cells and find them
empty.
144 INT. WINE CELLAR - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 144
ANGLE ON: The dwarves crowd around the barrels, skeptical.
[Bilbo:]
Everyone, climb into the barrels!
Quickly!
[Dwalin:]
Are you mad? They'll find us!
[Bilbo:]
No, no, they won't, I promise you.
Please, please, you must trust me!
The dwarves mill around, indecisive. Thorin and Bilbo
exchange glances. He turns to the others.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 134.
144 CONTINUED: 144
[Thorin:]
Do as he says.
Without question, the dwarves begin to climb into the
barrels, hardly able to fit inside. Fili pops his head out
of his barrel.
[Fili:]
What do we do now?
Bilbo stands beside a LARGE LEVER.
[Bilbo:]
Hold your breath.
[Fili:]
Hold my breath? What do you mean?
Bilbo furiously pulls on the lever and floor beneath the
barrels OPENS UP. The dwarves are sent into the river below
with a SPLASH. The floor closes behind them. Bilbo stands
beside the lever, triumphant.
CLOSE ON: The elves begin to wake from their stupor, hearing
the TUMBLING NOISE. Bilbo looks deeply troubled.
145 INT. ELVEN CELLS - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 145
ANGLE ON: Tauriel strides past the empty cells. She turns to
the elven guards.
TAURIEL
Where is the keeper of the keys?
146 INT. WINE CELLAR - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 146
Bilbo stomps against the trap door, frantic. The elves rise
from the table.
147 INT. WOODLAND REALM - DAY 147
WIDE ON: Tauriel leads the elven guards down a GRAND FLIGHT
OF STAIRS. The cellar is seen in the distance.
148 INT. WINE CELLAR - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 148
CLOSE ON: Bilbo looks up, seeing Tauriel and the other
elves.
ANGLE ON: He quickly shuffles backwards, tipping the floor
back. With a SCREAM, he falls into the river below.
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 135.
149 EXT. FOREST RIVER - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 149
CLOSE ON: Bilbo surfaces from under the water. He quickly
grabs onto Oin's barrel.
[Thorin:]
Well done, Master Baggins.
Bilbo holds up his hand in thanks. Thorin turns to the other
dwarves.
[Thorin:]
Come on, let's go!
ANGLE ON: The dwarves paddle with their hands as the river
pulls the barrels along.
150 INT. WOODLAND REALM - DAY 150
WIDE ON: Elves rush along passageways in the Woodland Realm.
Through the tree roots far below them, the dwarves are seen
floating along.
151 EXT. FOREST RIVER - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 151
ANGLE ON: The dwarves emerge into the sunlight. A LARGE
WATERFALL lies in their path.
[Thorin:]
Hold on!
CLOSE ON: Bilbo and the dwarves plunge through the rapids,
half drowned.
WIDE ON: The barrels bump into one another as they bob down
the RAGING RIVER.
152 EXT. GATEWAY - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 152
ANGLE ON: Legolas and Elros emerge from a back gate. They
spot the dwarves in the distance. Legolas turns to Elros.
[Legolas:]
(in Elvish; subtitled)
Shut the gate.
As Legolas races back inside, Elros pulls out a HORN. He
blows, sending a LOUD BLAST OF SOUND.
153 EXT. FOREST RIVER - WOODLAND REALM - DAY 153
The dwarves round a corner in the river. A STONE GUARDPOST
is built above the river, an open SLUICE GATE underneath.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 136.
153 CONTINUED: 153
CLOSE ON: HEAVILY ARMORED ELVES stand guard. One of the
elves pull a LEVER, closing the sluice gate.
[Thorin:]
No!
The barrels come to a stop before the gate. Thorin grabs
onto the grate and pushes against it, DESPERATE as the other
barrels pile up.
ANGLE ON: The elves draw out their swords, ready to spring
into action.
Suddenly, an elf is shot in the back. He falls forward,
revealing an ORC crouched behind him. The orc SNARLS,
leading a TROOP OF ORCS onto the guardpost. They wipe out
the other elves.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo and the dwarves look up, surprised. The dead
elves begin to fall into the water.
[Fili:]
Watch out! There's orcs!
ANGLE ON: From the riverbank, a MULTITUDE OF ORCS run out of
the bushes, led by Bolg.
BOLG
(in Black Speech;
subtitled)
Slay them all!
Orcs begin to throw themselves at the dwarves. Bilbo kills
several with Sting. The dwarves take the Orcish weapons,
using them to fend off the hoard of orcs.
CLOSE ON: Kili looks up, noticing the lever from above. He
gets out of his barrel and runs toward the lever.
[Dwalin:]
Kili!
ANGLE ON: Dwalin throws Kili and ORC SWORD. Kili catches it,
cutting down orcs as he makes for the lever.
From the riverbank, ELVES have begun to come onto the scene.
Bolg crushes them with his MACE. Just then, he notices Kili
on the guardspost. Bolg pulls out a LARGE BOW, and readies
an arrow.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 137.
153 CONTINUED: (2) 153
Kili reaches the lever. Suddenly, an arrow comes pelting
towards him. Ducking, he dodges the arrow and pulls the
lever.
WIDE ON: The sluice opens, letting the dwarves sail out into
the wild river.
From the riverbank, Bolg fires another arrow.
ANGLE ON: Kili dodges once again. Bolg fires a third arrow.
Kili expertly dodges for the third time. He jumps into his
barrel, floating down the forest river.
CLOSE ON: Bolg watches the dwarves sail away.
BOLG
(in Black Speech;
subtitled)
After them!
ANGLE ON: The orcs rush forward, following the river on
land.
The dwarves attempt to steer through the river to no avail.
The river is far too RAPID. They BOB UP AND DOWN the river,
waves crashing over them.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo hangs onto Oin's barrel for dear life,
COUGHING and SPLUTTERING all the while.
WIDE ON: Orcs from either side of the riverbank fire ARROW
AFTER ARROW at the Company.
Bilbo and the dwarves reach yet another waterfall. Water
SPLASHES OVER THEM. They reach the surface, nearly drowned.
Their eyes, ears and mouths FILLED WITH WATER.
ANGLE ON: From the guardpost, Tauriel and Legolas cut down
the orcs. Left and right, SLUMPED BODIES fall into the
river.
WIDE ON: The two elves jump over the guardpost, landing onto
the riverbank. Weapons raised, they race after Bolg and his
orcs.
CLOSE ON: An orc leaps out at Thorin. Thorin slices the orc
away, and continues to speed down in the river.
ANGLE ON: Legolas and Tauriel draw out their bows. They take
out the ORC ARCHERS, never needing more than one arrow for
each orc. Other elves dart along the riverbank, fighting
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 138.
153 CONTINUED: (3) 153
without mercy.
As the dwarves twist and turn down the river, dead orcs fall
into the river beside them. One orc makes to leap after
Balin from an OVERHANGING TREE BRANCH.
Mid-jump, Thorin throws his sword, pinning the orc to the
branch.
As they continue sailing down the river, the dwarves toss
weapons to one another, taking out an orc here and there.
An orc jumps forward and grabs onto Dwalin's barrel. He
headbutts the orc, sending it flying backwards. Dwalin
manages to catch its weapon. A STEEL AXE.
ANOTHER OVERHANGING BRANCH looms above them, this time with
nearly A DOZEN ORCS crouched on top.
[Thorin:]
Cut the log!
Each passing dwarf cuts against the branch, until finally
Dwalin gives a MIGHTY SWING. The log breaks apart, falling
into the treacherous river.
An orc armed with a JAVELIN springs into the river. He leaps
onto Gloin's barrel, digging the javelin into the wood. They
go through a SMALL WATERFALL, sending the orc toppling
backwards.
Gloin's barrel sails above him. The tip of the javelin rips
through the orc, who crashes onto a rock. Gloin's barrel
flies through the air, flips over a log, and finally
SPLASHES back into the water.
WIDE ON: The elves have caught up with the dwarves. They
fight beside them on the riverbank, sending a multitude of
dead orcs spiraling down into the river.
ANGLE ON: Legolas jumps over the river, his two feet landing
on the heads of Fili and Dwalin.
He sails down the river with this vantage point, shooting
down orcs on both sides of the river. Aiming carefully, he
manages to skewer two orcs with the SAME ARROW.
Satisfied, he leaps forward and lands on the riverbank. He
slides down the hillside, using a dead orc as a board.
Legolas strides across the river again, using the dwarves as
stepping stones.
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 139.
153 CONTINUED: (4) 153
He reaches the top of the riverbank, fighting off the last
remaining orcs. From behind him, an orc stealthily.
From the river, Thorin throws his sword. It cuts down the
orc behind Legolas. Legolas locks eyes with him, surprised.
Thorin scowls over at him, until he and the dwarves round a
corner. They are out of Thranduil's lands.
WIDE ON: Bolg and the last dozen orcs race after the
dwarves.
BOLG
(in Black Speech;
subtitled)
After them! Cut them off!
CLOSE ON: Legolas stares after the orcs, WEIGHING THE RISK.
Finally, he turns and heads back to the Woodland Realm.
154 EXT. STONY SHORE - FOREST RIVER - DAY 154
WIDE ON: The dwarves paddle through the now calm waters of
the river. A SLAB OF ROCK juts out of the water nearby.
[Thorin:]
Anything behind us?
[Balin:]
Not that I can see.
[Fili:]
I think we've outrun the orcs.
[Thorin:]
Not for long. We've lost the
current.
[Oin:]
Gloin is half drowned.
[Thorin:]
Make for the shore! Come, let's go!
ANGLE ON: The dwarves climb onto the rocky shore. Kili falls
to his feet, exhausted.
[Thorin:]
On your feet.
[Fili:]
Can't we rest?
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 140.
154 CONTINUED: 154
[Thorin:]
There's an orc pack on our tail. We
keep moving.
[Balin:]
To where?
[Bilbo:]
The mountain, we're so close.
[Balin:]
A lake lies between us and that
mountain. We have no way to cross
it.
[Bilbo:]
So then we go around.
[Dwalin:]
The orcs will run us down, as sure
as daylight. We have no weapons to
defend ourselves.
CLOSE ON: Thorin nods, troubled. He turns to Fili.
[Thorin:]
Fili, you have two minutes.
ANGLE ON: Relieved, Fili empties his water-filled boot into
the river. Slowly, a BOWMAN steps forward on the rocks above
the Company. He raises his bow, aiming towards Fili.
The dwarves look up, startled. Dwalin steps in front of
Fili, holding out a BRANCH in front of him. He GROWLS.
The Bowman fires the arrow, which lands straight in the
branch. Kili raises a rock above his head, but the Bowman
shoots it out of his hand.
[Bowman:]
Do it again, and you're dead.
Balin looks past the man, seeing a BARGE tethered into a
near DOCK. He approaches the Bowman, arms raised.
[Balin:]
Excuse me, but you're from
Laketown, if I'm not mistaken? That
barge over there, it wouldn't be
available for hire, by any chance?
(CONTINUED)
THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED... (SCRIPTED EDIT) 11/6/15 141.

The Bowman lowers his bow.

The Hobbit


[It is nighttime; rain falls heavily upon a small, dirty-looking town.]

[On screen:] Bree - on the borders of the Shire

[A figure wearing a pack and a raincoat walks through the streets. A disheveled-looking man with his hood down walks across the street, eating a carrot {this is Peter Jackson}. The figure with the pack is considerably shorter than the other people on the street. The figure walks up to a building and pauses, inspecting the sign hung above the door. It says, “The Prancing Pony.” The figure, which is Thorin, looks about, then enters the tavern. As he walks through, the bartender hands a drink to a man.]

[Bartender:] “There you are.”

[There is much raucous talk and laughter throughout the busy tavern. A black cat perches on a counter. A waitress {played by Katie, Peter Jackson’s daughter} threads through the crowd at the pub carrying a mug and a platter of cheese and bread. Drunk and unruly customers get in her way, and she moves around them.]

[Waitress]: “Watch it!”

[She makes her way to Thorin’s table and sets down the mug and platter.]

[Waitress:] “Here you are.”

[Thorin:] “Thank you.”

[Thorin puts down his pipe, which he had been smoking. He tears apart his bread and begins to eat it. As he eats, he looks around at all the activities going on in the pub. Sensing something, he looks to the right and sees a bald, suspicious-looking man watching him. He looks to his left and sees another shady character watching him. Thorin puts his bread back on his plate and, as the two men stand up and move toward him, slowly wraps his hand around the handle of his sword, which is strapped to his pack next to him.]

[Suddenly, a figure appears at the table in front of him. It is Gandalf, and he sits across from Thorin.]

[Gandalf:] “Mind if I join you?”

[As the waitress passes by, Gandalf catches her sleeve.]

[Gandalf:] “I’ll have the same.”

[The suspicious men back away as Gandalf begins to speak to Thorin.]

[Gandalf:] “I should introduce myself. My name is Gandalf. Gandalf the Grey.”

[Thorin:] “I know who you are.”

[Gandalf:] “Well now! This is a fine chance. What brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?”

[Thorin:] “I received word that my father had been seen wandering the Wilds near Dunland. I went looking, and found no sign of him.”

[Gandalf:] “Thorin, it’s been a long time since anything but rumor was heard of Thrain.”

[Thorin:] "He still lives; I am sure of it.”

[Gandalf looks up as the waitress sets his platter of food in front of him.]

[Thorin:] “My father came to see you before he went missing. What did you say to him?”

[Gandalf:] “I urged him to march upon Erebor; to rally the seven armies of the dwarves, to destroy the dragon and take back the Lonely Mountain. And I would say the same to you. Take back your homeland.”

[Thorin picks up his mug and drinks contemplatively.]

[Thorin:] “This is no chance meeting, is it, Gandalf?”

[Gandalf:] “No, it is not. The Lonely Mountain troubles me, Thorin. That dragon has sat there long enough. Sooner or later, darker minds will turn toward Erebor. I ran into some unsavory characters whilst traveling along the Greenway. They mistook me for a vagabond.”

[Thorin:] “I imagine they regretted that.”

[Gandalf:] “One of them was carrying a message.”

[Gandalf lays a dirty piece of cloth with a message and a picture of the Lonely Mountain drawn on it on the table and pushes it toward Thorin.]

[Gandalf:] “It is Black Speech.”

[Thorin, who had been reaching forward to take the message, warily pulls his hand away.]

[Gandalf:] “Promise of payment.”

[Thorin:] “For what?”

[Gandalf:] “Your head. Someone wants you dead. Thorin, you can wait no longer. You are the heir to the throne of Durin. Unite the armies of the dwarves. Together you have the might and power to retake Erebor. Summon a meeting of the seven dwarf families. Demand they stand by their oaths.”

[Thorin:] “The seven armies swore that oath to the one who wields the King's Jewel, the Arkenstone! It is the only thing that will unite them, and in case you have forgotten, that jewel was stolen by Smaug.”

[Thorin and Gandalf look up as the two shady men from before rise and leave together, looking back over their shoulders at Thorin and Gandalf.]

[Gandalf:] “What if I were to help you to reclaim it?”

[Thorin:] “How? The Arkenstone lies half a world away, buried beneath the feet of a fire-breathing dragon.”

[Gandalf:] "Yes, it does, which is why we are going to need a burglar."



[On screen:] 12 months later

[It is night in the present time, shortly after the ending of the first movie. Bilbo peeks over some rocks on a high ledge and watches Azog and his Warg Scouts running along a ridgeline not far away, occasionally stopping to smell the air in their pursuit of the Company. Not finding anything, they continue on their way. Suddenly, Bilbo hears a snarl from the side, and ducks behind the rocks. He peeks out and sees a large bear watching Azog from another pile of rocks, snarling softly. Bilbo sneaks away. The camera zooms in toward the bear, and the bear roars.]


[On screen:] THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG


[Bilbo has made his way down the rocks to where the dwarves and Gandalf are waiting to hear Bilbo's spy report.]

[Dwalin:] “How close is the pack?”

[Bilbo:] “Too close. A couple of leagues, no more, but that is not the worst of it.”

[Dwalin:] “Have the Wargs picked up our scent?”

[Bilbo:] “Not yet, but they will; we have another problem.”

[Gandalf:] “Did they see you? They saw you!”

[Bilbo:] “No, that's not it.”

[Gandalf smiles and turns to the dwarves.]

[Gandalf:] “What did I tell you? Quiet as a mouse. Excellent burglar material.”

[The dwarves chuckle loudly in appreciation of Bilbo. Bilbo looks exasperated that no one is hearing him out.]

[Bilbo:] “Will you listen- Will you just listen? I'm trying to tell you there is something else out there.”

[The dwarves look worried.]

[Gandalf:] “What form did it take? Like a bear?”

[Bilbo:] “Ye..."

[Bilbo pauses and looks curiously at Gandalf.]

[Bilbo] "Y- yes. But bigger, much bigger.”

[Bofur, to Gandalf:] “You knew about this beast?”

[Gandalf turns and walks a few steps away.]

[Bofur:] “I say we double back.”

[Thorin:] “And be run down by a pack of Orcs.”

[Gandalf:] “There is a house, it’s not far from here, where we might take refuge.”

[Thorin:] “Whose house? Are they friend or foe?”

[Gandalf:] “Neither. He will help us, or he will kill us.”

[The dwarves looks at each other in dismay.]

[Thorin:] “What choice do we have?”

[A roar splits the night behind them; it is the bear.]

[Gandalf:] “None.”



[The company is running through plains and across streams.]

[Gandalf:] “Come on!”

[As the Company runs through a forest, Azog and his Orcs are racing through the forest too. Azog urges his party on. Both groups stop suddenly when an ear-splitting roar sounds nearby.]

[Gandalf:] “This way, quickly!”

[As the dwarves panic and run, Bombur looks on in shock until he is pulled along.]

[Bofur:] “Bombur, come on!”

[As they exit the forest, they spy a house surrounded by a hedge in the middle of a plain.]

[Gandalf:] “To the house! Run!”

[The Company runs across the plain; Bombur, the fattest dwarf, outruns all the rest of them in his fear. They run through a gate in the hedge.]

[Gandalf:] “Come on, get inside!”

[They run to the front door of the house; it is closed. Bombur, who reaches the door first, throws himself against it but falls flat on his back when the door doesn’t budge. The rest of the dwarves catch up and begin throwing themselves against the door, trying to open it. Gandalf looks back as a massive bear breaks out from the edge of the forest and runs toward them.]

[Gandalf:] “Open the door!”

[Thorin:] “Quickly!” 

[Thorin, pushing through the dwarves pressed against the door, manages to raise the exterior bolt, opening the doors. The entire company bolts inside the house and they try to slam the door shut, but the bear has already gotten its head in the door. As the bear roars and tries to push the door open, the dwarves yell and strain to close it. Bilbo pulls out his sword and points it unsteadily at the bear.]



[Gandalf looks on in apparent amusement. The dwarves yell as they press against the door.]

[Dwalin:] “Come on, lads!”

[With a final heave, the dwarves manage to close the door and drop the bolt across it. They sigh in shock, fear, and tiredness.]

[Ori:] “What is that?”

[Gandalf:] “That...is our host.”

[The dwarves and Bilbo turn to Gandalf in bewilderment.]

[Gandalf:] “His name is Beorn, and he is a skin-changer.”

[Oin checks his hearing trumpet to make sure he has heard Gandalf correctly.]

[Gandalf:] “Sometimes he’s a huge black bear; sometimes he’s a great strong man. The bear is unpredictable, but the man can be reasoned with. However, he is not overfond of dwarves.”

[The dwarves look at each other in dismay. Ori peaks out a crack in the door.]

[Ori:] “He’s leaving!”

[Dori pulls him away from the door.]

[Dori:] “Come away from there! It’s not natural, none of it. It’s obvious: he’s under some dark spell.”

[Gandalf:] “Don’t be a fool; he’s under no enchantment but his own. Alright now, get some sleep, all of you. You’ll be safe here tonight.”

[The dwarves start spreading out through the house. Gandalf whispers quietly to himself.]

[Gandalf:] “I hope.”



[It is night; Beorn’s house is seen from a distance. A massive bear is growling and walking around; from the edge of the woods, Azog and his company watch the bear. One of his Orcs comes up to him.]

[Orc:] “Bu margi hum. Guri shugi khozdayil” [Subtitle: Attack them now. Kill the Dwarf filth while they sleep.]

[Azog:] “Shâ. Hulim nari arangish” [Subtitle: No. The Beast stands guard.]



[Azog angrily walks away from Beorn and the house, and his Orcs follow. They walk back to where the rest of their group is; several Wargs are seen fighting each other.]

[Azog:] “Zadgarimid ru mong” [Subtitle: We will kill them on the road.]

[Azog and his Orcs all snap to attention when they hear a sound, and they pull out their weapons. Another large, pale Orc astride a Warg runs up to them, and the Warg stops inches from Azog, growling at his face. Azog stands without flinching, although he snarls. The pale Orc, Bolg, is holding a weapon shaped like a sharp spinal column, and he has iron plates embedded in his skull and chest. ]

[Bolg:] “_ _ _”  [Subtitle: They are gathering in Dol Guldur. The Master has summoned you!]

[Azog growls in anger.]



[It is night in Beorn’s house. A mouse scampers across Beorn’s chessboard, which has pieces shaped like bears. The dwarves are sleeping all throughout the house. Some goats chew on hay. Bilbo, who was sleeping, sits up and looks around. After making sure that no one is watching him, he pulls out the Ring. As he examines it, a dark voice is heard chanting softly.]

“Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul,
ash nazg thrakatulûk, agh burzum ishi krimpatul.” 

[translation: One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.]

 

[As the chanting grows louder, the scene changes to Dol Guldur. It is night, and several Orcs are heading into the fortress.]

[Azog walks out onto a raised walkway in Dol Guldur. A darkness {“The Necromancer”} flies through the air and speaks to Azog.]

[Necromancer:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: We grow in number. We grow in strength. You will lead my armies.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: What of Oakenshield?]

[Necromancer:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: War is coming.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: You promised me his head!]

[The darkness flies right through Azog, and he spins around to face it.]

[Necromancer:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Death will come to all.]

[The Darkness disappears, leaving Azog snarling. An Orc comes to him

[Orc:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Do we call off the hunt?]

[Azog contemplates for a few seconds, then makes up his mind. He yells out a name into the dark.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Bolg!!]

[The Orcs turn as Bolg, much taller than any of the other Orcs, strides up to Azog, pushing the other Orcs aside. Scoff and Bog stand toe to toe, and they are equally large and dangerous looking. They glare at each other.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: I have a task for you. Do you still thirst for Dwarf blood?]

[Bolg, whose left eye is cloudy and blind, growls in agreement.]



[In the forest outside Beorn’s house, the bear ambles toward the house. At the edge of the forest, the bear stands on its hind legs, and its form melts into that of a tall man. The man looks toward the house.]

[Bilbo is sleeping in the house; hearing a noise, he wakes up and quietly peeks out of his blankets. He sees Beorn, in human form, enter.]

[It is morning; Beorn’s ponies prance through the fields. A very large bumblebee lands on Bilbo’s nose, waking him with a start. Putting on his jacket, he walks toward the kitchen, where all the dwarves and Gandalf are already seated. Beorn pours milk from a pitcher into Fili’s cup. He is much taller than any human, even taller than Gandalf. Beorn addresses Thorin.]

[Beorn:] “So you are the one they call Oakenshield. Tell me, why is Azog the Defiler hunting you?”

[Thorin:] “You know of Azog? How?”

[Beorn:] “My people were the first to live in the mountains, before the Orcs came down from the north. The Defiler killed most of my family, but some he enslaved.”

[Bilbo sees the remnants of manacles on Beorn’s wrist.]

[Beorn:] “Not for work, you understand, but for sport. Caging skin-changers and torturing them seemed to amuse him.” 

[Bilbo:] “There are others like you?”

[Beorn:] “Once, there were many.”

[Bilbo:] “And now?”

[Beorn:] “Now, there is only one.”

[The dwarves, Bilbo, and Gandalf look on in silence.]

[Beorn:] “You need to reach the mountain before the last days of autumn?"

[Gandalf:] “Before Durin’s Day falls, yes.”

[Beorn:] “You are running out of time.”

[Gandalf:] “Which is why we must go through Mirkwood.”

[Beorn:] “A darkness lies upon that forest. Fell things creep beneath those trees. There is an alliance between the Orcs of Moria and the Necromancer in Dol Guldur. I would not venture there except in great need.”

[Gandalf:] “We will take the Elven Road. That path is still safe.”
[Beorn:] “Safe? The Wood-Elves of Mirkwood are not like their kin. They’re less wise and more dangerous. But it matters not.”

[Thorin:] “What do you mean?”

[Beorn:] “These lands are crawling with Orcs. Their numbers are growing, and you are on foot. You will never reach the forest alive.”

[Thorin looks shocked. Beorn stands up from the table and faces Thorin.]

[Beorn:] “I don’t like dwarves. They’re greedy and blind, blind to the lives of those they deem lesser than their own.”

[Beorn picks up a mouse that had been scampering on the table and holds it, all the while approaching Thorin. who is standing with his arms crossed.]

[Beorn:] “But Orcs I hate more. What do you need?”



[The Company saddles and rides Beorn’s ponies. As they ride away, Beorn, who is staying at his house, looks around for danger.]

[Beorn:] “Go now, while you have the light. The hunters are not far behind.”

[The company rides rapidly across the land, slowing to a stop as they approach a looming, gloomy-looking forest. Gandalf dismounts and walks into the edge of the forest through an ancient archway.]

[Gandalf:] “The Elven Gate.”

[Gandalf turns and calls to the others.]

[Gandalf:] “Here lies our path through Mirkwood.”

[Dwalin:] “No sign of the Orcs. We have luck on our side.”

[Dwalin dismounts. Gandalf squints as he sees something in the distance; it is Beorn, in his bear-form, watching them from a distant ridge.]

[Gandalf:] “Set the ponies loose. Let them return to their master.”

[The dwarves and Bilbo dismount and begin taking their supplies off the ponies. Bilbo approaches the forest on foot.]

[Bilbo:] “This forest feels...sick, as if a disease lies upon it. Is there no way around?”

[Gandalf:] “Not unless we go two hundred miles north, or twice that distance south.”

[Gandalf follows a path a few feet further into the shadows and approaches a plant-covered statue. At the same time, Bilbo, who is standing by himself, reaches into his pocket and, after some internal conflict, slowly pulls out the Ring and fingers it. Just like when he examined it in Beorn’s house, we hear the voice whispering the “One Ring to rule them all” chant. As Gandalf approaches the statue, Galadriel suddenly appears; she is evidently thought-speaking to Gandalf from Rivendell.]

[Galadriel:] “Something moves in the shadows unseen, hidden from our sight. Every day it grows in strength. Beware the Necromancer. He is not what he seems.”

[Gandalf approaches the statue apprehensively, then quickly yanks off the vines, revealing a painted-on Eye of Sauron. We see the Flaming Eye of Sauron burst on the screen for a second, and Bilbo, holding the Ring, gasps slightly.]

[Galadriel:] “If our enemy has returned, we must know. Go to the tombs in the mountains.”

[Gandalf, hearing her words in his head, nods in agreement.]

[Gandalf:] “The High Fells. So be it.” 



[The unladen ponies trot away; Nori is just about to finish unsaddling Gandalf’s horse when Gandalf emerges from the forest.]

[Gandalf:] “Not my horse! I need it.”

[As Gandalf strides forward, the Company looks up and murmurs in surprise.]

[Bilbo:] “You’re not leaving us?”

[Gandalf:] “I would not do this unless I had to.”

[Gandalf looks at Thorin, then turns and looks at a dejected Bilbo.]

[Gandalf:] “You’ve changed, Bilbo Baggins. You’re not the same Hobbit as the one who left the Shire.”

[Bilbo:] “I was going to tell you; I...found something in the Goblin tunnels.”

[Gandalf:] “Found what?”

[Gandalf leans forward curiously and suspiciously; Bilbo doesn’t answer immediately, but fumbles with the ring in his pocket.]

[Gandalf:] “What did you find?”

[Bilbo stays silent for several more seconds, then finally responds.]

[Bilbo:] “My courage.”

[He removes his hand from his pocket.]

[Gandalf:] “Good. Well, that’s good. You’ll need it.”

[Gandalf turns and begins walking toward his horse; he speaks as he passes Thorin.]

[Gandalf:] “I’ll be waiting for you at the overlook, before the slopes of Erebor. Keep the map and key safe. Do not enter that mountain without me.”

[Gandalf stops and looks hard at Thorin as he says this, then continues toward his horse.]

[Gandalf:] “This is not the Greenwood of old. The very air of the forest is heavy with illusion. It will seek to enter your mind and lead you astray.”

[Bilbo, to Dwalin:] “Lead us astray? What does that mean?”

[Gandalf gets on his horse. It begins raining lightly, even though the sun is out.]

[Gandalf:] “You must stay on the path; do not leave it. If you do, you will never find it again.”

[Gandalf wheels his horse and rides away.]

[Gandalf:] “No matter what may come, stay on the path!”



[Thorin and Company turn toward the forest.]

[Thorin:] “Come on. We must reach the mountain before the sun sets on Durin’s Day.”

[Dwalin:] “Durin’s Day. Let’s go!”

 [Thorin:] “This is our one chance to find the hidden door.”

[The Company enters Mirkwood. They are following the paved path that started at the Elven Gate. Thorin leads. At one point, the path turns a corner.]

[Thorin:] “The path goes this way.”

[As the dwarves and Bilbo keep following the path through the forest, it twists and turns over all sorts of terrain such as bare ground, high ledges, fallen tree trunks, and more. The color palette used is very blue/gray, and gloomy. Dwalin thumps the handle of his hammer on the ground to find the paving stones of the trail.]

[Dwalin:] “This way.”

[They continue walking.]

[Bofur:] “Air. I need air.”

[Oin:] “My head, it’s spinning.”

[The dwarves suddenly run into each other as Nori, in front, stops abruptly.]

[Oin:] “What’s happening?”

[Thorin:] “Keep moving. Nori, why have we stopped?”

[Nori:] “The path...it’s disappeared!”

[Dwalin:] “What’s going on?”

[Oin:] “We’ve lost the path!”

[They are standing in front of a steep cliff, and there is no path ahead of them.]

[Thorin:] “Find it. All of you look. Look for the path!”

[Meanwhile, the path is not far away from them, but on the other side of the cliff. They had unknowingly left it some time ago.]

[The Company wanders through the forest. The forest is beginning to affect them mentally, and they stagger about.]

[Balin:] “I don’t remember this place before. None of it’s familiar.”

[Dori:] “It’s got to be here.”

[Thorin:] “What hour is it?”

[Dwalin:] “I do not know. I don’t even know what day it is.”

[Thorin:] “Is there no end to this accursed place?”

[The dwarves are all muttering and rambling as they wander about. Bilbo absentmindedly plucks a spiderweb; it vibrates, and the vibrations continue through the various linked spiderwebs and far off into the forest. Bilbo plucks the web again. He hears a strange whispering noise.]

[They continue walking; Bilbo looks down and sees himself walking backward, although it’s actually just an illusion. He looks back at Dori, behind him, and sees himself. His entire vision begins shifting and tilting. Ori leans down and picks up a tobacco pouch. Dori then takes it from him.]

[Ori:] “Look.”

[Dori:] “A tobacco pouch. There’s dwarves in these woods.”

[Bofur takes the pouch from Dori.]

[Bofur:] “Dwarves from the Blue Mountains, no less. This is exactly the same as mine.”

[Bilbo:] “Because it is yours. You understand? We’re going round in circles. We are lost.”

[Dwalin:] “We’re not lost. We keep heading east.”

[Oin:] “But which way is east? We’ve lost the sun.”

[As the dwarves begin bickering indistinctly, Bilbo looks up and sees a bit of sun through the tree canopy far above him. He speaks quietly, and no one else can hear him over the bickering.]

[Bilbo:] “The sun. We have to find the sun. Up there. We need to-”

[The dwarves have started fighting and pushing each other around. Thorin stands apart, listening. He hears the strange whispering sound that Bilbo heard earlier and mutters to himself.]

[Thorin:] “What? What’s that?”

[The whispering continues; Thorin turns and yells at the dwarves.]

[Thorin:] “Enough! Quiet! All of you! We’re being watched.”

[Bilbo climbs up one of the trees nearby; as he crawls, he doesn’t notice the masses of spiderwebs all around him. His head breaks through the trees and into the air; suddenly, it is as if a spell has been broken, and Bilbo’s head clears. As he breathes deeply, he sees blue butterflies flying all around him. The sun is setting, and everything looks beautiful. Bilbo smiles and laughs. He then looks off into the distance and sees several landmarks. He calls down loudly to the dwarves below.]



[Bilbo:] “I- I can see a lake! And a river. And the Lonely Mountain. We’re almost there!”

[He hears no reply from the dwarves.]

[Bilbo:] “Can you hear me? I know which way to go! Hello?”

[Bilbo looks down, trying to see the dwarves. He hears a thumping noise in the distance and looks up.]

[Bilbo:] “Hello?”

[In the distance, trees move haphazardly under the weight of something approaching. The movement is coming straight toward Bilbo and the dwarves. Worriedly, Bilbo climbs down a bit and peers around. He steps forward, only to trip over a spiderweb and fall several feet, bouncing painfully off branches, and yelling in pain and shock the entire time. He catches himself on a branch, then watches in horror as a web parts to reveal a massive spider. As the spider opens its fangs and hisses at him, Bilbo yells and falls again, landing on his back in an even bigger spiderweb. He is stuck to it and is thus unable to resist as the spider wraps him up tightly.]



[All of the dwarves have also been captured by giant spiders; the spiders have hung them upside down from tree branches. A spider tows a web-encased Bilbo toward the dwarves, then reaches for him with its jaws, presumably to administer its poison. Bilbo wakes up and realizes what is happening; just as the spider bends toward him, he manages to swing his sword, which he had been holding, straight up from his body, through the web, and into the spider. He guts it and flings it over the edge of the branch he had been lying on, sending it crashing to the forest floor. Bilbo quickly rips off the cocoon of web he has been wrapped in. Looking up, he sees the dwarves wrapped up and hanging from branches; he hides behind a tree trunk as a spider climbs up the other side of the trunk.]

[Bilbo pulls out his Ring from his pocket and slips it on his finger. In addition to becoming invisible, he enters the Ring’s “other dimension,” and he can suddenly understand what the spiders are saying.]

[Spider:] “Kiilll theemm. Kiill theemm.”

[Spider:] “Eat them now, _ _ _ and runny.”

[Spider:] “Their hide is tough. There is good juice inside.”

[Spider:] “Stick it again! Stick it again! Finish it off!” 

[The spiders surround one wrapped dwarf; the dwarf kicks, but can’t do much when wrapped up so tightly.]

[Spider:] “Ahh! The meat’s alive and kicking!”

[Spider:] “Kill them, kill them now. Let us feast.”

[The rest of the spiders take up the chant, “Feast! Feast!”]

[Bilbo, holding his sword in front of him, approaches the spiders. He ducks just in time as a spider crawls along a branch above him, going toward the dwarves. Bilbo throws a piece of wood away and to the side, causing all the spiders to rush after the source of noise.]

[Spiders:] “What is it? What is it? Kill it! Feast! Feast!”

[One spider stays behind and prepares to eat a wrapped and squirming Bombur.]

[Spider:] “Fat and juicy. Just a little taste.”

[The spider drops Bombur to the tree trunk and prepares to eat him. Bilbo sneaks up and strikes it on its rear with his sword. The spider spins around and hisses, but Bilbo is invisible to it. Bilbo keeps slicing at it, slicing away a leg and part of its head.]

[Spider:] “Curses! Where is it? Where is it?!”

[Bilbo pulls off his ring, revealing himself to the spider. He gives a little smile before he speaks.]

[Bilbo:] “Here!”

[Bilbo thrust his sword directly into the spider’s head.]

[Spider:] “It stings! Stings!”

[Bilbo pulls out his sword and the spider, dead, crashes to the ground. Bilbo looks at his sword.]

[Bilbo:] “Sting. That’s a good name.” 

[Bilbo looks toward where the dwarves are still wrapped and tied up.]

[Bilbo:] “Sting.” 



[Bilbo uses Sting to cut down all the dwarves. They land on the forest floor and proceed to rip off their wrappings, cursing and yelling the entire time.]

[Bofur:] “Where’s Bilbo?”

[Dwarves:] “Bilbo!”

[Bilbo:] “I’m up here!”

[Just then, a spider jumps at Bilbo from underneath the branch he was standing on, and it pins him underneath it. However, he manages to put his sword in front of him just in time, stabbing the spider through the belly. As the spider falls off the branch, Bilbo, entangled in its legs, falls with it. As the pair smashes against branches on their way down, Bilbo’s ring falls off his finger and lands some distance away from where Bilbo lands. Bilbo gets up and begins stumbling toward where the Ring fell.]

[Meanwhile, the dwarves have freed themselves and they try to escape, only to be surrounded by the returning spiders. They fight against the spiders with their various weapons. Bombur is knocked to the floor by a spider, and it stands over him to bite him.]

[Dwarf:] “Grab a leg!”

[The other dwarves grab each of the spider’s legs.]

[Dwarf:] “Pull!”

[The dwarves pull at the spider’s legs, and they manage to pull its legs right off its body. The dismembered body of the spider lands on Bombur.] 

[Bilbo is looking around for the Ring.]

[Bilbo:] “Where is it? Where is it? Come on. Where is it?”

[Bilbo slowly looks over his shoulder; he sees the Ring lying on the ground nearby. Relieved, he begins walking toward it.]



[Suddenly, a young, odd-looking spider emerges from the ground just behind the RIng. The spider’s legs push the Ring aside as the spider crawls toward Bilbo. Bilbo looks at it angrily, then rushes at it with his sword raised, yelling all the way. He begins to hack at the spider in a berserk manner, hacking and slicing all over the place.]

[The dwarves are still fighting the spiders. A spider manages to grab Kili.]

[Fili:] “Kili!”

[Bilbo continues hacking wildly at the spider, slicing off limbs, feelers, and more. He sticks his sword in its throat, ripping it out, then jumps and stabs the spider through the head and into the ground. As the spider falls, Bilbo pants heavily. He grabs the Ring off the ground, then holds it up and shows it to the dead spider.] 



[Bilbo:] “Mine!”

[Bilbo sits down and examines the Ring; as he gazes on it, the enormity of what he has just down dawns on him, and he looks shocked. He looks down and sees all the spiderwebs and gore on himself. He covers his mouth in shame and disgustedness. He is about to put the ring away when he hears a noise.]

[The dwarves have defeated their spiders, and are running through the forest. More spiders jump down on threads of silk in front of the dwarves and hiss at them. Thorin raises his sword in preparation to fight, but pauses and looks up. A blonde Elf, Legolas, runs through the treetops, then swings down a spider’s silk in order to land on it and kill it. He slides on the forest floor under the spider facing Thorin, slicing it in half, and comes up kneeling with an arrow nocked in his bow and pointed at Thorin. Several other Mirkwood elves appear, drawing arrows and pointing them at the dwarves.]

[Legolas:] “Do not think I won’t kill you, dwarf. It would be my pleasure.”



[The dwarves look around and see that they are completely surrounded and outnumbered by Mirkwood Elves, all with drawn bows aimed at the dwarves.]

[Kili:] “Help!”

[Fili:] “Kili!”

[The dwarves whirl around and see a spider pulling Kili away by the foot. A female Elf, Tauriel, runs through the forest. She kills three spiders with her bow and knife, then kills the spider pulling Kili with an arrow. She turns to attack another spider behind her, and yet another spider rushes toward Kili.]

[Kili:] “Throw me your dagger! Quick!”

[Tauriel:] “If you think I’m giving you a weapon, dwarf, you’re mistaken!”

[Tauriel kills her spider with her knife, then spins and throws the knife, killing the spider that was attacking Kili. Kili looks on in amazement.]



[Legolas:] “Search them.”

[The elves approach the dwarves and start searching them. An elf confiscates two of Fili’s knives. Legolas pulls a picture frame with two pictures out of Gloin’s pocket.]

[Gloin:] “Hey! Give it back! That’s private!”

[Legolas looks at a picture of a dwarf.]

[Legolas:] “Who is this? Your brother?”

[Gloin:] “That is my wife!”

[Legolas looks at the other picture, which is of a dwarf child.]

[Legolas:] “And what is this horrid creature? A goblin mutant?”

[Gloin:] “That’s my wee lad, Gimli.”

[Legolas raises his eyebrow at Gloin in contempt.]

[Meanwhile, the elf searching Fili finds even more knives all around his person. Fili sighs when the elf finds even some in a secret hidden pocket.]

[Legolas:] “Gyrth in yngyl bain?” [Subtitle: Are the spiders dead?]

[Tauriel:] “Ennorner gwanod in yngyl na nyryn. Engain nar.” [Subtitle: Yes, but more will come. They’re growing bolder.]

[Fili opens his jacket to show the elf searching him that he has no knives left; however, the elf finds another one hidden in Fili’s hood. An elf hands Legolas Thorin’s sword, Orcrist, and he inspects it.]

[Legolas:] “Echannen i vegil hen vin Gondolin. Magannen nan Gelydh.” [Subtitle: This is an ancient Elvish blade. Forged by my kin.] 

[Legolas:] “Where did you get this?”

[Thorin:] “It was given to me.”

[Legolas points the sword at Thorin.]

[Legolas:] “Not just a thief, but a liar as well.”

[Legolas:] “Enwenno hain!” [Rough translation: Take them!]

[The elves begin to lead the dwarves away. As they begin to walk, Bofur turns and whispers to Thorin]

[Bofur:] “Thorin, where’s Bilbo?”

[Thorin looks around, but sees no sign of Bilbo.]

[The dwarves are led over a bridge and into the Woodland Realm. After they pass through, Legolas addresses the guards of the gate.]




[Legolas:] “Holo in ennyn.” [Subtitle: Close the gate.]

[Bilbo, invisible, is running along the bridge and toward the gate. Legolas turns, sensing something, and looks down the bridge. Seeing nothing after a few seconds, he turns and walks through the gates as they closes. Bilbo, unseen, slips through the gates before they close.]

[The dwarves are led through the raised wooden walkways of the Woodland Realm. The entire place is built out of tree roots in a subterranean cavern. We see the King of Mirkwood, Thranduil, Legolas’s father, sitting on his throne.]



[The dwarves are pushed, protesting, into several cells.]

[Dwalin:] “This is not the end of it! You hear me?”

[Gloin:] “Let us out of here!”

[Dori:] “Get off me!

[The elf in charge of Fili finds another large dagger hidden in his coat, and Fili sighs in frustration. Kili addresses Tauriel as she locks him in his cell.]

[Kili:] “Aren’t you going to search me? I could have anything down my trousers.”

[Tauriel:] “Or nothing.”

[As Tauriel haughtily slams the cell door shut and walks away, Kili looks after her and smiles a little. Legolas stops Tauriel on her way out of the prison corridor.]

[Legolas:] “I Nogoth amman e tîr gin? Tauriel?” [Subtitle: Why does the Dwarf stare at you, Tauriel?]

[Tauriel:] “Ú-dangada?” [Subtitle: Who can say?]

[Tauriel looks away from Legolas as she says the next line, smiling a little and looking dreamy.]

[Tauriel:] “E orchal be Nogoth.” [Subtitle: He’s quite tall for a Dwarf.]

[She suddenly realizes what she’s doing and quickly looks at Legolas.]

[Tauriel:] “Pedithig?” [Subtitle: Do you not think?]

[As Tauriel walks away, Legolas addresses her.]

[Legolas:] “Orchal eb vui, mal uvanui en.” [Subtitle: Taller than some, but no less ugly.]

[Legolas and Kili glare at each other.]

[Dwalin and several other dwarves throw themselves against their cell doors, grunting in their effort. Balin finally yells at them.] 

[Balin:] “Leave it! There’s no way out. This is no Orc dungeon; these are the halls of the Woodland Realm. No one leaves here but by the king’s consent.”



[Meanwhile, Thorin has been brought before King Thranduil, and Thranduil addresses him.]



[Thranduil:] “Some may imagine that a noble quest is at hand. A quest to reclaim a homeland and slay a dragon. I myself suspect a more prosaic motive: attempted burglary, or something of that ilk.”

[Thranduil looks closely at Thorin.]

[Thranduil:] “You have found a way in. You seek that which would bestow upon you the right to rule: the King’s Jewel, the Arkenstone. It is precious to you beyond measure. I understand that. There are gems in the mountain that I too desire. White gems of pure starlight. I offer you my help.” 



[Thorin:] “I am listening.”

[Thranduil:] “I will let you go, if you but return what is mine.”

[Thorin turns and slowly starts walking away.]

[Thorin:] “A favor for a favor.”

[Thranduil:] “You have my word. One king to another.”

[Thorin stops walking. Still facing away from Thranduil, he speaks. His voice gets louder and louder as he speaks.]

[Thorin:] “I would not trust Thranduil, the great king, to honor his word should the end of all days be upon us!”

[Thorin spins around and point at Thranduil. He is now shouting.]

[Thorin:]  “You lack all honor! I’ve seen how you treat your friends. We came to you once, starving, homeless, seeking your help, but you turned your back. You turned away from the suffering of my people and the inferno that destroyed us!” 

[Thorin:]  “Imrid amrad ursul!” [Rough translation: Die a death of flames!]

[Thranduil leaps down from his throne and puts his face right in front of Thorin’s.]

[Thranduil:] “Do not talk to me of dragon fire. I know its wrath and ruin. I have faced the great serpents of the north.” 

[As Thranduil speaks, his face contorts, and we see his face covered with what appears to be burns and scars from his past encounters with dragons. His left eye is milky and unseeing. He draws away, and his face returns to normal.]

[Thranduil:] “I warned your grandfather of what his greed would summon, but he would not listen.”

[Thranduil turns and walks up the steps to his throne.]

[Thranduil:] “You are just like him.”

[Thranduil motions, and guards grab Thorin and haul him toward the dungeons.]

[Thranduil:] “Stay here if you will, and rot. A hundred years is a mere blink in the life of an elf. I am patient. I can wait.”



[Thorin is thrown into a cell beside the other dwarves, and his jailer walks away with a ring of jangling keys.]

[Balin:] “Did he offer you a deal?”

[Thorin:] “He did. I told him he could go ‘Ish kakhfê ai’d dur rugnu!’ [Rough translation: I spit upon your grave!] - him and all his kin!”

[Hearing this, Balin closes his eyes and sighs wearily in frustration.]

[Balin:] “Well...that’s it, then. A deal was our only hope.”

[Thorin:] “Not our only hope.” 



[We see Bilbo, invisible, sneaking through the Woodland Realm. Suddenly, Thranduil steps out from behind a corner and seemingly addresses him. Bilbo gives a little start, thinking that his invisibility doesn’t work.]

[Thranduil:] “I know you’re there. Why do you linger in the shadows?”

[Bilbo is petrified, thinking he has been found out, when suddenly Tauriel steps out of the shadows behind him. Realizing that the king was talking to her, Bilbo sighs in relief.]

[Tauriel:] “I was coming to report to you.”



[Thranduil:] “I thought I ordered that nest to be destroyed not two moons past.”

[Tauriel:] “We cleared the forest as ordered, my lord, but more spiders keep coming up from the south. They are spawning in the ruins of Dol Guldur; if we could kill them at their source-”

[Thranduil interrupts Tauriel.]

[Thranduil:] “That fortress lies beyond our borders. Keep our lands clear of those foul creatures, that is your task.”

[Tauriel:] “And when we drive them off, what then? Will they not spread to other lands?”



[Thranduil:] “Other lands are not my concern. The fortunes of the world will rise and fall, but here in this kingdom, we will endure.”

[Bilbo sneaks away; Thranduil, hearing a noise caused by Bilbo, looks his way. However, he looks back at Tauriel as she bows and walks away.]

[Thranduil:] “Legolas said you fought well today.”

[Tauriel smiles.]

[Thranduil:] “He has grown very fond of you.”

[Tauriel looks away, shocked and embarrassed.]

[Tauriel:] “I assure you, my lord, Legolas thinks of me as no more than a captain of the guard.”

[Thranduil:] “Perhaps he did once. Now, I’m not so sure.”

 [Thranduil walks past Tauriel to pour himself a cup of drink. Tauriel stays rooted in her spot, looking worried.]

[Tauriel:] “I do not think you would allow your son to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan elf.” 

[Thranduil:] “No, you are right. I would not. Still, he cares about you. Do not give him hope where there is none.”

[Behind Thranduil’s back, Tauriel looks worried and anguished.]



[Bolg and his orcs spy on the gate to the Woodland Realm.]

[Orc:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: The gates are guarded.]

[Bolg:] “Shugi golgai. Tud-dad nu!” [Subtitle: Not all of them. Follow me!]

[Bolg and his orcs stride away down the river.]



[In his cell, Kili inspects a shiny black stone with an engraving in his hand. He flips it in the air and catches it on the back of his hand. Tauriel is checking on all the prisoners; she pauses at Kili’s cell.]

[Tauriel:] “The stone in your hand, what is it?”



[Kili:] “It is a talisman. A powerful spell lies upon it. If any but a dwarf reads the runes on this stone, they will be forever cursed.”

[Kili quickly holds up the stone toward Tauriel, and she steps back slightly. She begins to walk away, but stops when Kili speaks again, in a laughing manner.]

[Kili:] “Or not, depending on whether you believe that kind of thing. It’s just a token.”

[Kili smiles, and Tauriel smiles as well.]

[Kili:] “A runestone. My mother gave it to me so I’d remember my promise.”

[Tauriel:] “What promise?”

[Kili:] “That I will come back to her.”

[Tauriel looks down.]

[Kili:] “She worries. She thinks I’m reckless.”

[Tauriel:] “Are you?”

[Kili:] “Nah.”

[He smiles and tosses up his stone. He misses when he tries to catch it, and it rolls out of his cell, but Tauriel stops it with her foot before it can roll into the deep pit outside the cells. She picks it up and inspects it. Kili goes up to the bars of his cell, then hears elves laughing in the distance.]

[Kili:] “Sounds like quite a party you’re having up there.”

[Tauriel:] “It is Mereth-en-Gilith, the Feast of Starlight.”

[She steps slightly away.]

[Tauriel:] “All light is sacred to the Eldar, but Wood Elves love best the light of the stars.”

[Kili:] “I always thought it is a cold light, remote and far away.”

[Tauriel, who had walked a few steps away while speaking, approaches Kili again and speaks earnestly.]

[Tauriel:] “It is memory, precious and pure. Like your promise.”

[Tauriel smiles and hands Kili back his stone.]

[Tauriel:] “I have walked there sometimes, beyond the forest and up into the night. I have seen the world fall away and the white light forever fill the air.”

[Kili:] “I saw a fire moon once. It rose over the pass near Dunland, huge; red and gold it was, filled the sky. We were an escort for some merchants from Ered Luin, they were trading in Silverbuck for furs. We took the Greenway south, keeping the mountain to our left, and then, this huge fire moon, right in our path. I wish I could show you...”

[They continue talking; Tauriel sits down on the stairs by Kili’s cell to listen. Unseen by them, Legolas watches from the distance, his face a blank mask.]



[Bilbo invisibly walks through the wine cellar. He sees elves moving around wine barrels and speaking. Once drinks from a large flagon; Bilbo sees the ring of dungeon keys in his hand.]

[Elf:] “...we’re running out of drink.”

[Elf:] “These empty barrels should have been sent back to Esgarrouth hours ago. The bargeman will be waiting for them.”

[Elf:] “Say what you like about our ill-tempered king, but he has excellent taste in wine. Come, Elros, try it.”

[He is speaking to an elf with a bunch of keys.]

[Elros:] “I have the dwarves in my charge.”

[The other elf takes the keys and hangs them on a hook in the wall.]

[Elf:] “They’re locked up; where can they go?”

[The elves laugh; Bilbo takes note of the hanging keys.]



[Bofur:] “I’ll wager the sun’s on the rise. It must be nearly dawn.”

[Ori:] “We’re never going to reach the mountain, are we?”

[Bilbo suddenly appears, holding up the ring of keys.]

[Bilbo:] “Not stuck in here, you’re not!” 



[Thorin and the other dwarves jump up in surprise; Bilbo hastily tucks his Ring into his pocket.] 

[Balin:] “Bilbo!”

[As the dwarves exclaim in surprise, Bilbo shushes them.]

[Bilbo:] “Shhh! There are guards nearby!”

[Bilbo unlocks Thorin’s cell and lets him out. He then proceeds to let all the dwarves out of their various cells, and they chuckle gleefully at their good fortune. Some of the dwarves start walking in a certain direction.]

[Dwarf:] “The stairs. You first. Ori!”

[Bilbo:] “Not that way, down here. Follow me.” 

[Bilbo proceeds lead the dwarves through the Woodland Realm, and they whisper indistinctly. They sneak through the halls of the Woodland Realm, and eventually find themselves in the wine cellar from before. The elves there are sound asleep around a table, with several empty bottles of wine in front of them. Bilbo leads the dwarves further in.]

[Bilbo:] “This way.”

[Kili:] “I don’t believe it;  we’re in the cellars!”

[The dwarves are getting mad at Bilbo.]

[Bofur:] “You were supposed to be leading us out, not further in!”

[Bilbo:] “I know what I’m doing!”

[Bofur:] “Shhh!”

[Bilbo:] “This way.”

[They sneak into a large room in which several barrels are stacked sideways down the middle of the room. All the barrels have one end open.]


[Meanwhile, elven guards open the cells and find them empty.]

[Elf:] “_ _ _!” 



[Bilbo:] “Everyone, climb into the barrels, quickly!”

[Dwalin:] “Are you mad?! They’ll find us!”

[Bilbo:] “No, no, they won’t, I promise you. Please, please, you MUST trust me!”

[The dwarves mill around, as they try to decide. They hear a commotion in the distance.] 

[Thorin:] “Do as he says!”

[Each of the dwarves climbs into a barrel. Bilbo walks along, counting to make sure all the dwarves have been accounted for.]

[Bofur:] “What do we do now?”



[All the dwarves stick their heads out of their barrels and watch Bilbo as he walks toward a lever in the ground.]

[Bilbo:] “Hold your breath.”
		


[Bofur:] “Hold my breath? What do you  mean?”

[Bilbo pulls the lever, and the part of the floor that the barrels were on tilts downward into an opening; the barrels roll out the opening and fall several feet into a river that runs beneath the Woodland Realm. The dwarves yell as they fall, and the barrels make loud thumping noises. The elves sleeping around the table stir and begin to wake up. Bilbo triumphantly looks around, then realizes that he forgot to get out himself, and that the trap door has closed.]




[Tauriel strides up to the empty cells and address the other elven guards.]

[Tauriel:] “Where is the keeper of the keys?” 

[In the cellar, Bilbo frantically runs back and forth and stomps on the ground, trying to make the floor tip again. Tauriel and her elves run toward the cellar.]

[Tauriel:] “Tolo hi!” [Rough translation: Come now!]

[Just as Tauriel and the guards get to the cellar, the floor tips and Bilbo falls into the river, yelling. He surfaces and grabs onto Nori’s barrel. Thorin and the company, still in their barrels, have been waiting for him.]



[Thorin:] “Well done, Master Baggins.” 

[Bilbo, half drowned, waves his hand in thanks and manages to splutter out a word.]

[Bilbo:] “Go.”

[Thorin:] “Come on, let’s go.”

[The dwarves paddle with their hands as the river pulls their barrels along; elves rush along passages in the Woodland Realm. The dwarves emerge into the sunlight, and Thorin sees a waterfall right in front of them.]

[Thorin:] “Hold on!”

[The dwarves, Bilbo, and the barrels plunge through the rapids, then float swiftly down the raging river. Legolas, followed by other elves, emerges from a gateway and sees them floating away.]

[Legolas:] “Holo in-annon!” [Subtitle: Shut the gate!]

[An elf with him blows on a horn; as the dwarves round a corner in the river, they see a guardpost built above the river. The heavily armored elves standing guard there hear the horn and come to attention; one of them pulls a lever, causing a heavy metal sluice gate to block the river. The dwarves in their barrels come to a stop at the gate, unable to float further.]



[Thorin:] “No!”

[The barrels pile into each other; the elven guards draw their swords, but one is suddenly shot in the back with a black arrow. Several growling orcs swarm over the guardpost, killing the elves. Multitudes of orcs run in from the bushes, with Bolg.]

[Bofur:] “Watch out! Those are orcs!”

[Bolg:] “Gorid! Zib! Goridug!” [Subtitle: Slay them all!]

[The orcs begin throwing themselves at the dwarves in their barrels; Bilbo manages to kill one with Sting, and Dwalin elbows another in the face. Kili looks up and sees the lever the elven guard had pulled earlier. He manages to get out of his barrel and runs up the stairs toward the lever. Unarmed, he ducks as an swings at him.]

[Dwalin:] “Kili!”

[Dwalin, who had managed to grab a sword from one of the elves or orcs, throws it to Kili, who then fights his way to the top of the stairs. As Kili fights an orc, another one leaps up from behind him, raising its spear to stab him. Fili throws a short sword or dagger and kills the orc, allowing Kili to fight his own opponent and kill it. Bolg, noticing Kili, pulls his bow and arrows from his back. As Kili reaches for the lever, Bolg fires an arrow, which hits Kili in the calf. Kili stops short, panting.]

[Fili:] “Kili!”

[Kili groans in pain and strains to pull the lever, but falls over onto his back. Bolg strings another arrow. Thorin looks shocked.]

[Thorin:] “Kili.”

[An orc leaps over to kill Kili, but an arrow suddenly flies into its head. Kili looks over and sees Tauriel running through the bushes. She shoots another orc, then kills others with her knife.]

[Bolg:] “Gor’-ash! Gor golginul! ” [Subtitle: Kill her! Kill the She-Elf!]

[Several orcs rush at Tauriel; Legolas and other elves appear from the bushes and shoot them down. As Tauriel, Legolas, and the other elves fight the orcs, Kili manages to grab the lever and pull it, opening the sluice get and letting the dwarves in their barrels through. He then falls on his back again in pain. The dwarves in barrels fall down another waterfall and float down the river. Bolg sees them.]

[Bolg:] “Khozdayin obguryash! Abgurid!” [Subtitle: After them!]

[Fili:] “Kili!”

[Kili manages to slide himself off the ledge and into his empty barrel below. As he lands in it, the shaft of the arrow in his leg breaks off on the edge of the barrel. Tauriel distractedly looks over at him and is attacked by an orc, but manages to kill the orc. The remaining dwarves and Bilbo plunge over the waterfall and continue floating down the rushing river, as Bolg and his orcs follow the river on land.]

[The dwarves try to paddle and steer with their hands, but to no avail; the river is running too wild. As they come to a narrow part of the river, orcs on either side begin shooting arrows at them. Meanwhile, back at the guardpost, Tauriel continues fighting orcs. Legolas leaps to the top of the guardpost as well.]

[In the river, an orc leaps at Thorin in his barrel, but he manages to kill it with a sword he grabbed earlier. Tauriel, Legolas, and the other elves run after the orcs chasing the dwarves, shooting them. An orc jumps from an overhanging tree branch toward Balin, but Thorin throws his sword and pins the orc to the tree; as the orc drops its weapon, Thorin catches it while floating beneath him, and he throws back to Bombur, who throws it to Nori, who throws it to Fili, who kills an orc with it. An orc leaps onto Dwalin barrel, only for Dwalin to headbutt it off and steal its axe. The dwarves see a low-hanging tree branch stretched across the river in front of them, with several orcs on it.]

[Thorin:] “Cut the log!”

[As he floats under it, Thorin hits it with his sword, then Bofur hits it with his weapon, and Dwalin, right behind him, hits the branch with his axe, breaking it and causing the orcs on it to fall into the river. Bilbo manages to climb atop a floating barrel.]

[Dwalin:] “Bombur!”

[Dwalin throws his axe to Bombur, who kills an orc that had just jumped onto his barrel. The Orc’s spear ends up pinning it to an overhanging tree branch; the other end of the spear catches onto Bombur’s barrel and catapults it through the air and onto the riverbank, where the barrel rolls and tramples multitudes of orcs. The barrel flips through the air to the other side of the river, where it tramples more orcs. Eventually, the barrel comes to a stop, and orcs surround it; however, Bombur kicks out the bottom, then sticks his arms holding axes through the sides. He then starts spinning rapidly with the axes extended, mowing down all the orcs around him. He then runs toward the river, tosses his axe to one of the floating dwarves, then gracefully jumps into an empty barrel.]

[Meanwhile, Legolas, Tauriel, and the other elves have caught up to the dwarves and orcs, and they fight the orcs. At one point, Legolas leaps over the river and lands with a foot on the heads of two dwarves, from this vantage point, he shoots orcs on either riverbank. He aims carefully, and manages to skewer two orcs through the head with one arrow. Legolas continues fighting orcs, using the heads of floating dwarves as stepping stones to get across the river. While he is preoccupied fighting an orc, another orc runs up behind him and raises its sword to kill him; Thorin, from his barrel in the river, throws his sword and manages to kill the orc behind Legolas. Legolas and Thorin look at each other with some sort of understanding; Legolas stops pursuing them as the dwarves continue floating down the river. It seems like all the orcs are dead. However, as Legolas watches the dwarves float away, an orc draws its bow and aims at him; it shoots, but its arrow is suddenly deflected in the air by Tauriel’s own arrow. As Legolas spins around in surprise, Tauriel attacks the orc and forces it to its knees. Just before she can decapitate it with her knife, Legolas stops her.]

[Legolas:] “Tauriel! Dartho! Ú-no hono. Ho hebo cuin.” [Subtitle: Tauriel! Wait! This one we keep alive.]

[Bolg and his remaining orcs continue chasing the dwarves.]

[Bolg:] “Ban khozdai-go! Sha-mogi obguryash!” [Subtitle: After them! Cut them off!]

[Legolas stares after the dwarves for a second, then turns and heads back toward the Woodland Realm. Tauriel watches the dwarves floating away, being chased by orcs, and looks conflicted as to whether or not she should follow them or Legolas.]





 
[Meanwhile, Gandalf walks up a hill and finds some ruins; he is then seen carefully climbing a narrow stone ledge built into the side of a tall, bare, mountain. Just as he reaches a door in the side of the mountain, the stone ledge he is standing on crumbles away, and he begins to fall, but manages to catch himself and climbs onto the entrance of the doorway. A set of metal interlocking bars that had in the past covered the doorway now sit broken and bent away from the opening. Gandalf steps through the doorway and into a short tunnel going into the mountain; he is suddenly grabbed by some invisible force and he is pulled swiftly into the mountain. The tunnel end in a vast, cavernous hollow in the mountain, and the ground falls away into the distance at the end of the tunnel. Gandalf manages to stop himself from falling into the pit. He blows the end of his staff and makes it glow; with this light, he examines his surroundings. On the far wall of the cavern, he sees a door similar to the one he had just entered; he goes to it by carefully walking on narrow stones set in the sides of the cavern.]



[This door’s metal grate has also been broken and bent away. Gandalf enters the crypt and sees a tomb inside. However, the cover of the tomb has been broken. Suddenly, a bird flies out of the broken tomb at Gandalf. Gandalf starts, then turns around to find Radagast behind him.]

[Gandalf:] “Oh, it’s YOU!”

[Radagast:] “Why am I here, Gandalf?”

[Gandalf:] “Trust me, Radagast. I would not have called you here without good reason.”

[Radagast removes his hat, and three birds fly into the nest on his head. He then replaces his hat.]

[Radagast:] “This is not a nice place to meet.”



[Gandalf:] “No, it is not.”

[They exit the crypt and look around at the cavern.]

[Radagast:] “Theses are dark spells, Gandalf. Old, and full of hate. Who was buried here?”

[Gandalf:] “If he had a name, it’s long since been lost. He would have been known only as a servant of evil. One of a number. One of nine.”

[Gandalf illuminates the lower part of the cavern, and we see eight other crypts like the first, all with their metal bars bent and broken away from the insides of the crypts.]



[Gandalf and Radagast leave the mountain.]

[Radagast:] “Why now, Gandalf? I don’t understand.”

[Gandalf:] “The Ringwraiths have been summoned to Dol Guldur.”

[Radagast:] “But it cannot be the Necromancer. A human sorcerer could not summon such evil.”

[Gandalf:] “Who said it was human?”

[Radagast, who had been walking, stops abruptly.]

[Gandalf:] “The Nine only answer to one master. We’ve been blind, Radagast, and in our blindness, the Enemy has returned.”

[Radagast looks shocked.]

[Gandalf:] “He is summoning his servants. Azog the Defiler is no ordinary hunter. He is a commander, a commander of legions. The enemy is preparing for war. It will begin in the east. His mind is set upon that mountain.”

[Gandalf turns and begins to walk away.]

[Radagast:] “Where are you going?”

[Gandalf:] “To rejoin the others.”

[Radagast:] “Gandalf!”

[Gandalf:] “I started this; I cannot forsake them. They are all in grave danger.”

[Radagast:] “If what you say is true, the world is in grave danger. The power in that fortress will only grow stronger.”

[Gandalf looks away.]

[Gandalf:] “You want me to cast my friends aside?” 





[The river has calmed down, and the dwarves paddle along in their barrels with their hands.]

[Thorin:] “Anything behind us?”

[Balin:] “Not that I can see.”

[Bofur:] “I think we’ve outrun the orcs.”

[Thorin:] “Not for long; we’ve lost the current.”

[Dwalin:] “Bofur is half drown.”

[Thorin:] “Make for the shore! Come on, let’s go!”

[The dwarves and Bilbo paddle to the riverbank; they climb out onto a slab of rock jutting out a bit into the river.] 

[Dwalin:] “Come on!”

[When Kili is on the rocks, he falls to his knees in pain from the arrow wound in his thigh; it has been bound with cloth, but blood is seeping through. Bofur looks at him concernedly.]

[Kili:] “I’m fine, it’s nothing.”

[Thorin:] “On your feet.”

[Fili:] “Kili’s wounded. His leg needs binding.”

[Thorin:] “There’s an orc pack on our tail; we keep moving.”

[Balin:] “To where?”

[Bilbo:] “To the mountain; we’re so close.”

[Balin:] “A lake lies between us and that mountain. We have no way to cross it.”

[Bilbo:] “So then we go around.”

[Dwalin:] “The orcs will run us down, as sure as daylight. We have no weapons to defend ourselves.”

[Thorin:] “Bind his leg, quickly. You have two minutes.”

[While they bind Kili’s leg, some of the dwarves sit down and Ori kneels by the river to empty his boot of water. Unbeknownst to them, a man, Bard, sneaks up over the pile of rocks and aims an arrow at Ori. As the dwarves realize a man is there, they jump up, and Dwalin, holding a branch, leaps in front of Ori. He raises the branch and begins to charge the man, but the man shoots his arrow and it embeds itself right in the middle of the branch, between Dwalin’s hands. Kili raises a rock to throw, but the man shoots the rock out of his hand too.]



[Bard:] “Do it again, and you’re dead.”

[Balin, who is standing near the edge of the group, sees a barge floating in the river behind Bard. He talks to Bard, approaching him slowly with his hands held in the air.]

[Balin:] “Excuse me, but, uh, you’re from Laketown, if I’m not mistaken? That barge over there, it wouldn’t be available for hire, by any chance?”

[Bard lowers his bow.]

[Bard climbs aboard his barge as the dwarves approach.]

[Bard:] “What makes you think I will help you?”

[Balin:] “Those boots have seen better days.”  

[Bard begins loading the dwarves’ empty barrels into his barge.]

[Balin:] “As has that coat. No doubt you have some hungry mouths to feed. How many bairns?”

[Bard:] “A boy and two girls.”

[Balin:] “And your wife, I’d imagine she’s a beauty.”

[Bard:] “Aye. She was.”

[Balin’s smile fades.]

[Balin:] “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to-”

[He is interrupted by Dwalin whispering loudly to Thorin.]

[Dwalin:] “Oh, come on, come on, enough with the niceties.”

[Bard:] “What’s your hurry?”

[Dwalin:] “What’s it to you?”

[Bard:] “I would like to know who you are and what you are doing in these lands.”

[Balin:] “We are simple merchants from the Blue Mountains journeying to see our kin in the Iron Hills.”

[Bard:] “Simple merchants, you say?”

[Thorin:] “We’ll need food, supplies, weapons. Can you help us?”

[Bard looks at the barrels and examines the various dents and nicks they received during the fight with the orcs.]

[Bard:] “I know where these barrels came from.”

[Thorin:] “What of it?”

[Bard:] “I don’t know what business you had with the elves, but I don’t think it ended well. No one enters Laketown but by leave of the Master. All his wealth comes from trade with the Woodland Realm. He will see you in irons before risking the wrath of King Thranduil.”

[Bard boards his barge and tosses a rope to Balin. Thorin mouths to Balin.]

[Thorin:] “Offer him more.”

[Balin:] “I’ll wager there are ways to enter that town unseen.”

[Bard:] “Aye. But for that, you will need a smuggler.”

[Balin:] “For which we will pay double.”

[Bard looks at him suspiciously.]



[The orcs run beside the river in pursuit of the dwarves, who the current has carried far ahead of the orcs.]

[Bolg:] “Sha mogi obguryash!” [Rough translation: Don’t let them go away!]



[In the woodland realm, Legolas and Tauriel have brought their captured orc to Thranduil’s throneroom. As Legolas stands with his knife pressed to the orc’s neck, Thranduil paces around it.]

[Thranduil:] “Such is the nature of evil. Out there in the vast ignorance of the world it festers and spreads, a shadow that grows in the dark. A sleepless malice as black as the oncoming wall of night. So it ever was; so will it always be. In time, all foul things come forth.” 

[Legolas:] “You were tracking a company of thirteen dwarves. Why?”
 
[Orc:] “Not thirteen; not any more. The young one, the black-haired archer, we stuck him with a Morgul shaft.”

[The orc speaks this while facing Tauriel; she looks worried.]

[Orc:] “The poison’s is in his blood. He’ll be choking on it soon.”

[Tauriel:] “Answer the question, filth.”

[Orc:] “Sha hakhtiz khunai-go, Golgi!” [Subtitle: I do not answer to dogs, She-Elf!]

[Legolas pushes the orc a bit as Tauriel whips out her knife.]

[Legolas:] “I would not antagonize her.”

[Tauriel:] “You like killing things, orc? You like death? Then let me give it to you!”

[Tauriel rushes forward with her knife, but Thranduil speaks.]

[Thranduil:] “Farn! Tauriel, ego! Gwao hi.” [Subtitle: Enough! Tauriel, leave! Go now.]

[The orc snarls at her, but Tauriel manages to regain her composure and leaves.]

[Thranduil:] “I do not care about one dead dwarf. Answer the question. You have nothing to fear. Tell us what you know and I will set you free.”

[Legolas:] “You had orders to kill them - Why? What is Thorin Oakenshield to you?”

[Orc:] “The dwarf runt will never be king.”

[Legolas:] “King? There is no king under the mountain nor will there ever be. None would dare enter Erebor, whilst the dragon lives.”

[Orc:] “You know nothing! Your world will burn!”

[Legolas:] “What are you talking about? Speak!”

[Orc:] “Our time has come again. My master serves the One. Do you understand now, Elfling? Death is upon you. The flames of war are upon you-”



[Thranduil, whose eyes have widened upon hearing about “the One,” suddenly whips out his sword and beheads the orc, leaving the orc’s head in Legolas’s hand.]

[Legolas:] “Why did you do that? You promised to set him free.”

[Thranduil:] “And I did. I freed his wretched head from his miserable shoulders.”

[The orc’s body, although separated from its head, shakes violently. Thranduil stomps on its leg to stop the shaking.] 

[Legolas:] “There was more the orc could tell us.”

[Thranduil:] “There was nothing more he could tell me.”

[Thranduil turns and walks away, sheathing his sword.]

[Legolas:] “What did he mean by the ‘flames of war’?”

[Thranduil:] “It means they intend to unleash a weapon so great it will destroy all before it.”

[Thranduil addresses the elven guards.]

[Thranduil:] “I want the watch doubled at all our borders. All roads, all rivers. Nothing moves but I hear of it. No one enters this kingdom, and no one leaves it.”



[Legolas approaches the elves guarding the entrance to the Woodland Realm.]

[Legolas:] “Holo in ennyn! Tiro i defnin hain na ganed en-Aran.” [Subtitle: Close the gate! Keep it sealed by order of the King.]

[Legolas turns to walk away, but one of the guards calls out.]

[Elf Guard:] “Man os Tauriel?” [Subtitle: What about Tauriel?]

[Legolas stops short.]

[Legolas:] “Man os sen?” [Subtitle: What about her?]

[Elf Guard:] “Edevín eb enedhor na gû a megil. En ú-nandollen.” [Subtitle: She went into the forest armed with her bow and blade. She has not returned.]

[As Legolas walks toward the gate, the guard points out toward the forest in the direction Tauriel went. Legolas looks anxious.]



[Bolg and his orcs arrive at the rock where the dwarves met Bard. One of the orcs tastes a pool of liquid.]

[Orc:] “_ _ _ nash! Agra-yi.” [Subtitle: Dwarf blood! They were here.]

[Bolg:] “Nuzdi-arg nash…hum an bunish!” [Subtitle: There is another scent…man flesh!]

[Bolg:] “_ _ _“ [Subtitle: They have found a way to cross the lake.]



[Bard paddles the dwarves and Bilbo across the lake in his barge. It is very foggy, and the barge pushes aside ice floes. Suddenly, large stone formations appear out of the fog.]

[Bofur:] “Watch out!”

[Bard expertly poles the barge between the rock formations, which turn out to be ancient ruins.]



[Thorin:] “What are you trying to do, drown us?”  

[Bard:] “I was born and bred on these waters, Master Dwarf. If I wanted to drown you, I would not do it here.”

[Dwalin:] “Oh I have enough of this lippy lakeman. I say we throw him over the side and be done with him.”

[Bilbo answer him slightly angrily.]

[Bilbo:] “Ohh, Bard, his name’s Bard.”

[Bofur:] “How do you know?”

[Bilbo:] “Uh, I asked him.”

[Dwalin to Thorin:] “I don’t care what he calls himself, I don’t like him.” 

[Balin:] “We do not have to like him, we simply have to pay him. Come on now, lads, turn out your pockets.”

[The dwarves begin pulling out their money and valuables. Dwalin whispers to Thorin.]

[Dwalin:] “How do we know he won’t betray us?”

[Thorin:] “We don’t.”

[Balin counts the money.]

[Balin:] “There’s, um, just a problem: we’re ten coins short.”

[Thorin:] “Gloin. Come on. Give us what you have.”

[Gloin:] “Don’t look to me. I have been bled dry by this venture! And what have I seen for my investment? Naught but misery and grief and-”

[Gloin stops talking when he realizes that all the others have slowly stood up and are looking at something in the distance. As the fog thins, we see the Lonely Mountain.]

[Gloin:] “Bless my beard. Take it. Take all of it.”

[Gloin hands Balin a sack of coins he had secretly withheld before. Bilbo coughs and gestures his head toward Bard, who is approaching the dwarves on their end of the barge.]

[Bard:] “The money, quick, give it to me.”

[Thorin:] “We’ll pay you when we get our provisions, but not before.”

[Bard:] “If you value your freedom, you’ll do as I say. There are guards ahead.”

[The dwarves turn and see the rooftops of Laketown in the distance.]



[Bard’s barge is stopped at a dock just outside the city; Bard hops off and speaks to a man. Meanwhile, the dwarves and Bilbo are hidden in the barrels on the barge.]

[Dwalin:] “Shh, what’s he doing?”

[Bilbo peers through a hole in his barrel.]

[Bilbo:] “He’s talking to someone.”

[Bilbo sees Bard point back at his barrels while talking to the man.”

[Bilbo:] “And he’s...pointing right at us!”

[Thorin looks anxious. Bard shakes the man’s hands.]

[Bilbo:] “Now they’re shaking hands.”

[Thorin:] “What?”

[Dwalin:] “That villain! He’s selling us out.”

[All the dwarves in their individual barrels listen anxiously; suddenly, dead fish are poured into the barrels. The dwarves splutter in surprise.]

[Bard poles his barge toward the gate of the city; on deck are the 14 barrels all full of fish, with a dwarf or hobbit inside as well.]

 [Dwarf:] “Oh god.”

[Bard kicks the barrel closest to him.]

[Bard:] “Quiet! We’re approaching the toll gate.”

[Gatekeeper:] “Halt! Goods inspection. Papers, please. Oh, it’s you, Bard.”

[Bard brings him boat up to the gatekeeper’s office, and the gatekeeper steps out to see him.]

[Bard:] “Morning, Percy.”

[Percy:] “Anything to declare?” 

[Bard:] “Nothing, but that I am cold and tired, and ready for home.”

[Bard hands the gatekeeper some papers.]

[Percy:] “You and me both.”

[As the gatekeeper takes the papers and goes into his office to stamp them, Bard looks around warily.]

[Gatekeeper:] “Here we are. All in order.”

[He holds out Bard’s papers, but a man, Alfrid, suddenly steps out of the shadows and grabs the papers.]

[Alfrid:] “Not so fast.”

[Alfrid reads Bard’s papers, then looks at his load.]

[Alfrid:] “Consignment of empty barrels from the Woodland Realm. Only, they’re not empty, are they, Bard?”

[Alfrid tosses Bard’s papers to the wind and approaches him, with some of Laketown’s soldiers behind him.]

[Alfrid:] “If I recall correctly, you’re licensed as a bargeman, not a fisherman.”

[As Alfrid says this, he picks up one of the fish from a barrel and holds it up to Bard. He doesn’t see Bombur’s eyes looking up from the gap where the fish had been.]

[Bard:] “That’s none of your business.”

[Alfrid:] “Wrong. It’s the Master’s business, which makes it my business.”

[Bard:] “Oh come on, Alfrid, have a heart. People need to eat!”

[Alfrid:] “These fish are illegal.”

[Alfrid throws the fish he was holding into the water, then commands the soldiers.]

[Alfrid:] “Empty the barrels over the side.”

[The soldiers, lead by their captain, Braga, move to comply.]

[Braga:] “You heard him. Into the canal. Come on, get a move on.”

[The soldiers begin tipping the barrels over and letting the fish fall into the canal.]

[Bard:] “Folk in this town are struggling. Times are hard. Food is scarce.”

[Alfrid:] “That’s not my problem.”

[Bard:] “And when the people hear the Master is dumping fish back in the lake, when the rioting starts, will it be your problem then?”

[Bard and Alfrid stare at each other intensely for a few seconds, then finally Alfrid raises his hand to the soldiers.]

[Alfrid:] “Stop.”

[The soldiers stop tipping the barrels over and return to the buildings.]

[Alfrid:] “Ever the people’s champion, eh, Bard? Protector of the common folk? You might have their favor now, bargeman, but it won’t last.]

[Alfrid walks away.]

[Percy:] “Raise the gate!”

[A large portcullis blocking the channel is raised, and Bard begins to pole his barge through. As he passes, Alfrid turns around and shouts to him.]

[Alfrid:] “The Master has his eye on you; you’d do well to remember. We know where you live.”

[Bard:] “It’s a small town, Alfrid; everyone knows where everyone lives.”

[We see a bird’s eye view of Laketown; it’s a town built in the middle of the lake, and it looks quite poor and ramshackle. There are many channels of water throughout the town, through which various boats float. Bard poles his barge down the main channel.]





[Alfrid:] “All this talk of civil unrest; someone’s been stirring the pot, sire.”

[Alfrid is in the Master’s bedchamber, and the Master has just woken up and is standing in his nightgown. Alfrid empty’s the Master’s chamberpot out a window. The Master groans and moans as he stumbles about, then sits down, rubbing his knees.]

[Master:] “Gah! Auh!”

[Alfrid:] “Gout playing up, sire?”

[Master:] “It’s the damp. It’s the only possible explanation. Now get me a brandy.”

[Alfrid moves to comply.]

[Alfrid:] “The mood of the people, sire, it’s turning ugly.”

[Master:] “They’re commoners, Alfrid. They’ve always been ugly. It’s not my fault that they live in a place that stinks of fish oil and tar. Jobs, shelter, food, that’s all they ever bleat about.”

[Alfrid hands the Master a glass of brandy, and he drinks it all in one shot.]

[Alfrid:] “It’s my belief, sire, they’re being lead on by troublemakers.”

[Master:] “Then we must find these troublemakers and arrest them!”

[Alfrid and the Master, who is now dressed, descend to the Master’s study. The Master is drinking another glass.]

[Alfrid:] “My thoughts exactly, sire.”

[Master:] “And all this talk of change must be suppressed. I can’t afford to let them rebel, band together and start making noises. The next thing you know, they’ll start asking questions, forming committees, launching inquiries.”

[At his desk, the Master pours yet another tall glass of brandy.]

[Alfrid:] “Out with the old, in with the new.”

[Master:] “What?”

[Alfrid:] “That’s what they’ve been saying, sire. There is even talk of an election.”

[Master:] “An election!? That’s absurd. I won’t stand for it.”

[As the Master walks away, Alfrid speaks softly such that only he can hear.]

[Alfrid:] “I don’t think they’d ask you to stand, sire.” 

[The Master opens glass doors and walks out onto his balcony, looking over Laketown. He mutters to himself.]

[Master:] “Shirkers. Ingrates. Rabble-rousers. Who would have the nerve to question my authority? Who would dare? Who….Bard. You mark my words, that trouble-making bargeman is behind all this.”



[Meanwhile, Bard docks his barge. After looking around, he knocks over one of the barrels, and a dwarf falls out along with a pile of fish. Bard continues knocking over barrels. He reaches for Dwalin’s barrel, but Dwalin pokes his head up through the fish.]

[Dwalin:] “Get your hands off me.”

[The remaining dwarves and Bilbo struggle out of their barrels, looking greasy and slimy from the fish. The dock keeper looks on in shock. Bard approaches him and slips him a coin.]

[Bard:] “You didn’t see them, they were never here. The fish you can have for nothing.”

[Bard leads the Company away.]

[Bard:] “Follow me.”

[A woman working on a boat happens to look up and she sees the dwarves running through Laketown in the distance. She looks shocked.]

[As they stride through Laketown, Bard’s son, Bain, runs up to Bard.]

[Bain:] “Da! Our house, it’s being watched.] 

[Bard looks at Thorin and hatches a plan.]

[Bard and his son walk along back to their house. As they walk, a fisherman in a boat sees them and drops his eyepatch over one eye, then knocks with his staff on a wall nearby {This is Stephen Colbert}. Upon this signal, two boys run from the wall, and one knocks over a contraption which causes a hammer to hit a bell. At this signal, another man lights a match to light his pipe. He turns and looks at two men in a fishing boat right next to Bard’s house, and they nod and switch their poles to the opposite sides of the boat than before. They do this just as Bard and Bain get to their house and enter through the door. Just before Bard enters, he tosses an apple to one of the fisherman.]

[Bard:] “You can tell the Master that I’m done for the day.”

[Inside the house, Bard’s daughters, Sigrid and Tilda, greet their father.]

[Tilda:] “Da! Where have you been?”

[Sigrid:] “Father! There you are. I was worried.”

[Both daughters run to their father, and they hug. Bard then hands his bag to Sigrid.]

[Bard:] “Here’s something to eat. Bain, get them in.”

[As Bard looks out a window, Bain goes down some steps to the lower floor of the house, which is open to the water. After looking around, he knocks on the wall near the toilet three times. Dwalin’s head appears through the toilet, which is open to the water below.]

[Dwalin:] “If you speak of this to anyone, I’ll rip your arms off.”

[Dwalin raises the seat and begins to pull himself out of the toilet. Bain reaches out to help him, but Dwalin slaps his hand away.]

[Dwalin:] “Get off.”

[Bain:] “Up there.”

[Bain points up the stairs, and Dwalin goes up. Bilbo pokes his head up through the toilet, looking flabbergasted, and Bain helps him out. The rest of the dwarves follow and head upstairs.]

[Sigrid:] “Da...why are there dwarves climbing out of our toilet?”

[Tilda:] “Will they bring us luck?”

[Nori emerges from the toilet with some leaves stuck to his hair.]



[The dwarves are wrapped in blankets, and their wet things have been laid in front of the fire to dry. Some of them shiver.]

[Bard:] “It may not be the best fit, but it’ll keep you warm.”

[Tilda passes out blankets, and Bilbo thanks her when he receives one.]



[Bilbo:] “Thank you very much.”

[Thorin looks out a window and sees a wooden tower not far away. Atop the tower is a windlass, a giant cross-bow type weapon with four arms. Thorin looks at it in shock.]

[Thorin:] “A Dwarvish Wind-Lance.”

[Bilbo, who is sipping a hot drink from a mug, looks at the wind-lance too.]

[Bilbo:] “You look like you’ve seen a ghost.” 

[Balin:] “He has. The last time we saw such a weapon, a city was on fire. It was the day the dragon came.”

[Thorin looks sadly away, and the scene switches to a flashback, but with Balin still narrating in real time.]

[FLASHBACK: Smaug is attacking the city of Dale. He blows fire, destroying buildings.]

[Balin:] “The day that Smaug destroyed Dale. Girion, the Lord of the city, rallied his bowman to fire upon the beast.”

[The city is in flames, but a man in armor, Girion, leads a group of archers in shooting at the flying dragon.]

[Balin:] “But a dragon’s hide is tough, tougher than the strongest armor. Only a black arrow, fired from a wind-lance, could have pierced the dragon’s hide, and few of those arrows were ever made.”

[Girion runs to a rack holding three long, heavy, black arrows, each made of metal and at least 4 feet long, and grabs one. He turns and loads it into a Dwarvish Wind-Lance, and draws the arrow. He turns the wind-lance, aiming for the dragon. It is difficult to see the dragon because it is flying swiftly and because the air is full of smoke. Girion fires, and the arrow hurtles through the air. It hits the dragon in the chest but bounces harmlessly off.] 

[Balin:] “His store was running low when Girion made his last stand.”

[Girion grabs another black arrow into the wind-lance and fires. This arrow too finds it mark, but bounces off the dragon’s chest.]
 
[END OF FLASHBACK.]

[Thorin:] “Had the aim of Men been true that day, much would have been different.”



[Bard approaches Thorin.]

[Bard:] “You speak as if you were there.”  

[Thorin:] “All dwarves know the tale.”

[Bain:] “Then you would know that Girion hit the dragon. He loosened a scale under the left wing. One more shot and he would have killed the beast.”

[Dwalin:] “Ha ha ha! That’s a fairy story, lad. Nothing more.”

[Thorin strides up to Bard.]

[Thorin:] “You took our money. Where are the weapons?”

[Bard:] “Wait here.”

[Bard goes down the stairs to the lower part of the house. After looking around to make sure no one is watching, he pulls on a rope hanging off a small boat and pulls up a wrapped package that had been hidden underwater.]



[While Bard is doing this, Thorin, Balin, Fili, and Kili talk quietly together.]

[Thorin:] “Tomorrow begins the last days of autumn.”

[Balin:] “Durin’s Day falls morn after next. We must reach the mountain before then.”

[Kili:] “And if we do not? If we fail to find the hidden door before that time?”

[Fili:] “Then this quest has been for nothing.”

[Bard returns and lays the package on the table as the dwarves stand around it. He loosens the wrappings and reveals a couple of hand-made weapons. The dwarves look at them in shock, then pick up the weapons and look at them in disgust.]



[Thorin:] “What is this?”

[Bard:] “Pike-hook. Made from an old harpoon.”

[Kili:] “And this?”

[Bard:] “A crowbill, we call it, fashioned from a smithy’s hammer. It’s heavy in hand, I grant, but in defense of your life, these will serve you better than none.”

[Thorin and Dwalin look disgustedly at each other.]

[Gloin:] “We paid you for weapons. Iron-forged swords and axes!”

[Bofur:] “It’s a joke!”

[Bofur throws his weapon back on the table, and the other dwarves follow suit.]

[Bard:] “You won’t find better outside the city armory. All iron-forged weapons are held there under lock and key.”

[Thorin and Dwalin look at each other out of the corners of their eyes, hatching a plan.]

[Balin:] “Thorin.”

[Bard looks up at the mention of the name Thorin, as if the name sounds familiar to him.]

[Balin:] “Why not take what’s been offered and go? I’ve made do with less; so have you. I say we leave now.”

[Bard:] “You’re not going anywhere.”

[Dwalin:] “What did you say!?”

[Bard:] “There’s spies watching this house and probably every dock and wharf in the town. You must wait till nightfall.”

[Hearing this, the dwarfs begin to settle down. Kili, leaning on a pole, looks like he’s in pain and he slowly slides down the pole and sits on a couch. Wincing, he examines the bandage on his leg while making sure no one is looking.]

[Bard is standing on his porch; he talks to himself, trying to recall where he’d heard the name ‘Thorin’ before.]

[Bard:] “Thorin…”

[With a sudden shock of understanding, he whirls around and looks at the Lonely Mountain in the distance. The door opens, and Bain sticks his head out.]

[Bain:] “Da?”

[Bard:] “Don’t let them leave.”

[Bard hurries down his steps and into the town.]



[Tauriel, in pursuit of the orcs, comes to a rocky promontory at the end of the river and at at the banks of the lake. Far across the lake, Laketown is visible. On the rocks are pieces of a deer that the orcs had previously shot and ripped apart. Hearing something, Tauriel turns her head slightly and reaches for something at her side. She whips around and comes to a crouch with an arrow nocked to her bow. Several yards behind her is Legolas, also with his bow drawn.]



[Tauriel:] “Ingannen le Orch.” [Subtitle: I thought you were an Orc.]

[Legolas:] “Cí Orch im, dangen le.” [Subtitle: If I were an Orc, you would be dead.]

[They both lower their bows.]

[Legolas:] “Tauriel, you cannot hunt thirty orcs on your own.”

[Tauriel:] “But I’m not on my own.”

[Legolas smiles.]

[Legolas:] “You knew I would come.”

[Tauriel smiles.]

[Legolas:] “The king is angry, Tauriel. For 600 years, my father has protected you, favored you. You defied his orders; you betrayed his trust.”



[Legolas:] “Dandolo na nin...e gohenatha.” [Subtitle: Come back with me...he will forgive you.]

[Tauriel:] “Ú-’ohenathon. Cí dadwenithon, ú-’ohenathon im.” [Subtitle: But I will not. If I go back, I will not forgive myself.]

[Tauriel:] “The king has never let orc-filth from our lands, yet he would let this orc-pack cross our borders and kill our prisoners.”

[Legolas:] “It is not our fight.”

[Tauriel:] “It is our fight. It will not end here. With every victory, this evil will grow. If your father has his way, we will do nothing. We will hide within our walls, live our lives away from the light, and let darkness descend. Are we not part of this world?”



[Tauriel:] “Tell me, mellon [Elvish for “friend”], when did we let evil become stronger than us?”

[Legolas looks conflicted.]



[Bard runs through Laketown. He runs into a shop, and the storekeeper greets him.]



[Storekeeper:] “Hello, Bard. What’re you after?”

[Bard begins looking through a pile of tapestries.]

[Bard:] “There was a tapestry, an old one; where’s it gone?”

[Storekeeper:] “What tapestry you talking about?”

[Bard:] “This one.”

[He picks up a tapestry and unrolls it on a table. It has the names of the members of the Line of Durin sewn into it. He overhears the woman who saw the dwarves earlier speaking to some other townpeople not far away.]

[Woman:] “There were dwarves, I tell you. Appeared out of nowhere. Full beards, fierce eyes; I’ve never seen the like.”

[Fisherman:] “What are dwarves doing in these parts?”

[Old man:] “It’s the prophecy.”

[Fisherman:] “Prophecy?”

[Old man:] “The prophecy of Durin’s folk.”

[Bard traces through the lineage on the tapestry and finds the last entry, Thorin. He looks up, thinking deeply, and talks to himself.]

[Bard:] “The prophecy...prophecy.”

[The people of Laketown are beginning to talk about the dwarves now as the word spreads.]

[Man:] “The old tales will come true.”

[Woman:] “Vast halls of treasure!”

[Another woman:] “Can it really be true? Has the lord of silver fountains returned?”

[This phrase jolts Bard’s memory, and he begins to recite the prophecy to himself.]

[Bard:] “The lord of silver fountains,
The king of carven stone,
The king beneath the mountain shall come into his own,
And the bells shall ring in gladness at the mountain king’s return,
But all shall fail in sadness and the lake will shine and burn.”

[Bard runs quickly to his house; the setting sun causes the lake to glow orange as he recites the last line of the prophecy. Bard burst into his house and finds no dwarves remaining. His son comes up to him.]

[Bain:] “Da! I tried to stop them-”

[Bard:] “How long have they been gone!?”



[It is night at Laketown. The dwarves are sneaking through the town toward the armory, hiding from watchmen. They hide behind a boat as two watchmen walk by.]

[Dwalin:] “Shh! Keep it down.”

[Thorin:] “As soon as we have the weapons, we make straight for the mountain. Go, go, go!”

[With the watchmen gone, Thorin points to Nori, who gets a running start and runs up a pyramid of dwarves who have pressed themselves against the walls of the city armory. He is able to get high enough that he can reach a second floor window and dive through.]

[Thorin:] “Next.”

[Bilbo does the same thing as Nori.]

[Soon, several dwarves are in the armory, and they begin collecting the weapons stored there. Kili struggles under a load of several different weapons, and Thorin hands him another one.]

[Thorin:] “You all right?”

[Kili:] “I can manage. Let’s just get out of here.”

[Thorin looks at Kili, then lays another sword on the pile Kili is holding. Kili begins walking down the stairs, but his wounded leg gives way and he falls with a cry. The weapons make a terrible clanging noise, and the dwarves both inside and outside look around warily. In the distance, the watchmen cry out, and running footsteps approach.]

[Dori:] “Run!”

[The dwarves still outside begin to run, but are stopped by two watchmen pointing pikes at them. Bilbo and the dwarves in the armory grab weapons, but several other guards point pikes at them too. Braga, the captain of the guard, is holding Kili with a dagger to his throat. Kili looks sadly and guiltily at Thorin.]

[Alfrid pokes his head out of the door to the Master’s mansion to see the commotion. He sees the soldiers dragging the dwarves to the mansion, with multitudes of townspeople following behind. It is snowing a little.]

[Dwalin:] “Get off of me!”

[Lots of indistinct muttering and yelling. Alfrid closes the door and goes to get the master. Braga arranges all of the dwarves under guard in the town square before the doors of the mansion. As guards open the doors of the mansion, the Master storms out, still putting on his coat.]

[Master:] “What is the meaning of this?”

[Braga:] “We caught ‘em stealing weapons, sire.”

[Master:] “Ah. Enemies of the state, then.”

[Alfrid:] “This is a bunch of mercenaries if ever there was, sire.”



[Dwalin:] “Hold your tongue. You do not know to whom you speak. This is no common criminal; this is Thorin, son of Thrain, son of Thror!”

[Dwalin gestures at Thorin, and Thorin steps forward. The crowd murmurs in amazement.]

[Thorin:] “We are the dwarves of Erebor.”

[The crowd whispers in shock and recognition, and people crane their heads to see better.]

[Thorin:] “We have come to reclaim our homeland. I remember this town and the great days of old. Fleets of boats lay at harbor, filled with silks and fine gems. This was no forsaken town on a lake! This was the center of all trade in the North.”

[Thorin is speaking earnestly to the crowd, and the people nod in agreement.]

[Thorin:] “I would see those days return. I would relight the great forges of the dwarves and send wealth and riches flowing once more from the halls of Erebor!”

[The people cheer and clap, and the Master looks on, calculating. Suddenly, a voice calls out over the crowd, and Bard strides forward.]

[Bard:] “Death! That is what you will bring upon us. Dragon-fire and ruin. If you awaken that beast, it will destroy us all.”



[The people whisper anxiously.]

[Thorin:] “You can listen to this naysayer, but I promise you this; If we succeed, all will share in the wealth of the mountain. You will have enough gold to rebuild Esgaroth ten times over!”

[The people shout in excitement and they applaud. The Master looks on, smiling and nodding at this turn of events.]



[Bard:] “All of you! Listen to me! You must listen! Have you forgotten what happened to Dale?!”

[The people quiet down and shake their heads sadly.]

[Bard:] “Have you forgotten those who died in the firestorm?!”

[The people shout, “No!”] 

[Bard:] “And for what purpose? The blind ambition of a mountain-king so riven by greed, he could not see beyond his own desire!”

[As Bard and Thorin stare at each other angrily, the crowd gets louder, but then the Master steps forth.]

[Master:] “Now, now, we must not, any of us, be too quick to lay blame. Let us not forget that it was Girion, Lord of Dale, your ancestor, who failed to kill the beast!”

[The Master points accusingly at Bard, and the crowd begins to clamor. As Bard looks away, Thorin looks at him in shock and anger.]

[Alfrid:] “It’s true, sire. We all know the story: arrow after arrow he shot, each one missing its mark.” 

[Bard looks around as the crowd yells angrily at him. He then strides forward and speaks to Thorin earnestly.]

[Bard:] “You have no right, no right to enter that mountain!”

[Thorin:] “I have the only right.”

[Thorin turns and faces the Master.]

[Thorin:] “I speak to the Master of the men of the Lake. Will you see the prophecy fulfilled? Will you share in the great wealth of our people?”

[The people quietly watch in anticipation.]

[Thorin:] “What say you?”

[The Master thinks for several seconds, then smiles and points his finger at Thorin.]

[Master:] “I say unto you...welcome! Welcome and thrice welcome, King under the Mountain!”

[The Master opens his arms in welcome, and the crowd erupts in cheers. Bard looks on silently.]

[Thorin climbs up a few steps and turns to face the audience; the people hug each other in excitement and joy. Thorin and Bard stare at each other.]



[It is morning in Laketown; the people crowd along the sides of the main channel as a boat is loaded with supplies for the dwarves to take to the mountain.]

[Bilbo:] “You do know we’re one short; where’s Bofur?”

[Thorin:] “If he’s not here, we leave him behind.”

[Balin:] “We have to, if we’re to find the door before nightfall. We can risk no more delays.”

[They march along the pier and the dwarves begin to board the boat. They are fully decked out in armor and regal clothing. Thorin stops Kili before he can get in the boat.]

[Thorin:] “Not you. We must travel with speed, you will slow us down.” 

[Kili smiles, thinking Thorin is joking.]

[Kili:] “What are you talking about? I’m coming with you.”

[Thorin:] “No.”

[Fili, already in the boat, turns and looks at Thorin and Kili.]

[Kili:] “I’m going to be there when that door is opened, when we first look upon the halls of our fathers, Thorin.”

[Thorin:] “Kili, stay here. Rest. Join us when you’re healed.”

[Thorin lays his hand on Kili’s shoulder and smiles at him, but Kili looks shocked and betrayed. Thorin turns to board the boat. Kili turns away. Oin gets out of the boat.]

[Oin:] “I’ll stay with the lad. My duty lies with the wounded.”

[Fili:] “Uncle, we grew up on tales of the mountain. Tales you told us. You can’t take that away from him!”

[On the shore, Oin is examining Kili, but Kili is trying to pull away from him.]

[Thorin:] “Fili.”

[Fili:] “I will carry him, if I must!”

[Thorin:] “One day you will be king, and you will understand. I cannot risk the fate of this quest for the sake of one dwarf, not even my own kin.”

[Fili looks at Kili, then steps out of the boat. Thorin tries to stop him.]

[Thorin:] “Fili, don’t be a fool. You belong with the Company.”

[Fili:] “I belong with my brother.”

[Fili pulls away from Thorin and goes to join Kili and Oin.]

[The musicians of Laketown play their instruments as the Master climbs up to a raised platform. He waves, and the people cheer and clap.]

[Further away in a house in the town, a sleeping Bofur is woken up by the sound of the music. He is asleep under a table, and as he jolts upright, he smacks his head on the bottom of the table.]

[Bofur:] “By my beard, is that the time? Oh, ugh.” 

[Bofur scrambles up unsteadily and runs out the door, grabbing a glass of drink on his way. In the background, the Master is addressing the people. Bofur runs as fast as he can toward the crowd.]

[Master:] “...Bring good fortune to all!”

[The Master smiles and waves to the dwarves in the boat as they pull into the canal and begin to paddle away. Kili looks on miserably from the dock. The dwarves in the boat smile, wave, and bow at the cheering people.]

[Dori:] “Goodbye!”

[Bofur pushes his way through the townspeople and reaches the water, only to find the boat of dwarves far off down the canal. He turns and finds Kili, Fili, and Oin.]

[Bofur:] “Ah! So you missed the boat as well?”

[Suddenly, Kili moans in pain and begins to fall over, but Fili catches him.]

[Fili:] “Kili? Kili!”

[Oin tries to examine him.]



[Bard opens his door to find Bofur, Fili, Kili, and Oin on his doorstep.]

[Bard:] “No. I’m done with dwarves. Go away.”

[He tries to slam the door shut, but Bofur stops it with his foot.]

[Bofur:] “No, no, no! No one will help us; Kili’s sick. He’s very sick.”

[Bard sees Kili being supported by Oin and Fili; he looks extremely sick. Bard hesitates.]



[Meanwhile, Bilbo and the rest of the Company are in their boat, heading across the lake toward the Lonely Mountain. As the other dwarves row, Thorin stands at the bow of the boat, facing ahead. They are all decked out in regal clothes and armor from Laketown.]

[They climb the foothills of the mountain. At one point, Thorin, recognizing the landscape, runs atop an embankment overlooking a valley. As the other dwarves join him, they look at the other end of the valley and see the ruins of Dale.]



[Bilbo:] “What is this place?”

[Balin:] “It was once the city of Dale. Now it is a ruin. The desolation of Smaug.”



[Thorin:] “The sun will soon reach midday; let’s find the hidden door into the mountain before it sets. This way!”

[Bilbo:] “Wait...is this the overlook? Gandalf said to meet him here. On no account were we-”

[Thorin interrupts him abruptly.]

[Thorin:] “Do you see him? We have no time to wait upon the wizard. We’re on our own.”

[Thorin turns and walks away.]

[Thorin:] “Come.”

[The other dwarves follow him; Bilbo looks back at the city, conflicted.]



[Radagast and Gandalf approach the bridge to Dol Guldur.]

[Gandalf:] “Dol Guldur. The hill of sorcery.” 

[Radagast:] “It looks completely abandoned.”

[Gandalf:] “As it is meant to. A spell of concealment lies over this place, which means our enemy is not yet ready to reveal himself. He has not regained his full strength. Radagast, I need you to carry a message to the Lady Galadriel. Tell her we must force his hand.”

[Radagast:] “What do you mean?”

[Gandalf:] “I’m going in alone. On no account come after me. Do I have your word?”

[Radagast slowly walks away as Gandalf speaks.]

[Radagast:] “Yes, yes, yes, yes.”

[As Radagast prepares to leave, Gandalf begins striding across the bridge toward Dol Guldur. Radagast suddenly turns around and calls to Gandalf.]

[Radagast:] “Wait, Gandalf! What if it’s a trap?”



[Gandalf:] “Turn around, and do not come back.”

[Radagast turns and walks away, and Gandalf speaks quietly so that Radagast cannot hear.]

[Gandalf:] “It’s undoubtedly a trap.”



[Gandalf draws his sword, then, with his sword in one hand and staff in the other, he strides across the bridge.]

[Gandalf is walking through Dol Guldur. It seems abandoned; even the rocks look weathered and broken. Still, there is an air of menace about the place. There are many pieces of sharp metal forged to look like vines of thorns. Gandalf walks into a large open area and begins reciting a spell.]

[Gandalf:] “Cé ná ulco sís nurtaina…I ettuluvas caninye! Cánin i sá tanuvaxe!” [Subtitle: The evil that is hidden here...I command it come forth! I command it reveal itself!]

[With these words, Gandalf strikes his staff on the ground. From the jewel at the top of the staff, an orb of light/energy emanates and moves like a shockwave away, passing through all the matter around Gandalf. This seems to be a spell that reveals hidden evil. However, it reveals nothing yet. Seeing nothing, Gandalf walks to a new place and begins saying the spell again.]

[Gandalf’s voice is heard echoing; Azog listens to it.]

[Azog:] “Zidgu.” [Subtitle: The Wizard has come.]

[Orc:] “Obtoragish gulum-nu. Gimyashim!” [Subtitle: He is lifting the spell. He will find us!]

[Azog:] “Hurnash.” [Subtitle: Yes…he will.]

[We see many Orcs and Wargs with Azog.]



[Thorin stands his sword in the ground and pants. He calls up to the other dwarves, who are all scouring the sides of the Mountain, trying to find the secret entrance.]

[Thorin:] “Anything?”

[Dwalin:] “Nothing!”

[Thorin:] “If the map is true, the hidden door lies directly above us.”

[Bilbo, walking around, sees a massive statue of a dwarf carved into the side of the mountain. Looking closely, he notices a set of stairs built into the statue.]

[Bilbo:] “Up here!”

[Thorin:] “You have keen eyes, Master Baggins.”



[They painstakingly make their way up the steep and treacherous steps and find a little rock-walled clearing in the side of the mountain. Thorin runs to the clearing.]

[Thorin:] “This must be it. The hidden door.”

[The remaining dwarves and Bilbo come into the clearing as well.]

[Thorin:] “Let all those who doubted us rue this day!”

[As Thorin holds up his key, the others cheer.]

[Dwalin:] “Right. We have our key, which means that somewhere, there is a keyhole.”

[He begins exploring the walls of the clearing with his fingers, looking for a keyhole. Thorin walks to the edge of the clearing and looks out at the setting sun.]

[Thorin:] “The last light of Durin’s Day will shine upon the keyhole.”

[Thorin looks at the wall and tries to figure out what the light hitting the wall means. As the sun gets lower and lower on the horizon and nothing changes on the wall, Thorin begins to get frantic.]

[Thorin:] “Nori.”

[Nori, who is known as a thief, runs to the wall and begins tapping it in different places with a spoon while holding his ear to a cup held against the wall. Meanwhile, Dwalin strains and pushes against the wall. The sun gets lower.]

[Thorin:] “We’re losing the light.”

[Dwalin:] “Come on!”

[Dwalin begins kicking at the wall.]

[Nori:] “Be quiet! I can’t hear when you’re thumping.”

[Dwalin:] “I can’t find it...it’s not here! It’s not here.”

[As the sun gets closer to disappearing, Thorin frantically gestures to the other dwarves.]

[Thorin:] “Break it down!”

[Dwalin, Gloin, and Bifur smash at the wall with their weapons, to no avail.]

[Thorin:] “Come on!“

[Balin:] “It’s no good! The door’s sealed. It can’t be opened by force. Powerful magic on it.”

[The dwarves hitting the door drop their weapons in tiredness and disapointedness. The sun disappears behind distant mountains.]

[Thorin:] “No!”

[Thorin stumbles forward and re-examines the old map, reading aloud.]

[Thorin:] “The last light of Durin’s Day will shine upon the keyhole. That’s what it says.”

[He holds his arms open is disbelief; the other dwarves mutter in disappointment and anger.]

[Thorin:] “What did we miss?”

[Thorin walks up to Balin and repeats his question, earnestly and tearfully.]

[Thorin:] “What did we miss, Balin?”

[Balin:] “We’ve lost the light. There’s no more to be done. We had but one chance.”

[The dwarves bow their heads in despair and turn back toward the stairs.]

[Balin:] “Come away; it’s...it’s over.”

[Bilbo:] “Wait a minute!”

[Gloin:] “You wait.”

[Bilbo:] “Where are they going? You can’t give up now!”

[Bilbo looks beseechingly at Thorin, but Thorin turns away. He holds up his key and looks at it, then drops it to the ground, where it clatters.]

[Bilbo:] “Thorin...you can’t give up now.”

[But Thorin throws the map at Bilbo’s chest and walks past him. The dwarves begin descending down the stairs, but Bilbo stays in the clearing. He recites the riddle from the map to himself while gesturing with his hands.]

[Bilbo:] “Stand by the grey stone...”

[He goes and stands by the grey wall.]

[Bilbo:] “When the thrush knocks...”  

[He looks around but doesn’t see a thrush anywhere.]

[Bilbo:] “The setting sun...and the last light of Durin’s Day will shine. Hmm. The last light. Last light…”

[He turns away from the wall, thinking hard and muttering to himself. With a thought, he looks up and sees the clouds move aside to reveal the moon. He looks at it wonderingly and sees that it illuminates the clearing. Hearing a noise, he turns back and sees a thrush hitting a snail against the grey wall. Just then, the moonlight hits the wall.]
 


[As the thrush flies away, Bilbo laughs with relief and delight and points at the wall.]

[Bilbo:] “The last light!”

[The moonlight illuminates a keyhole in the rock, and Bilbo gasps in surprise, then yells for the dwarves, who have already gone, to hear. He peers over the edge of the clearing at the stairs, but sees no sign of the dwarves.]

[Bilbo:] “The keyhole! Come back! Come back! It’s the light of the moon, the last moon of autumn! Ha ha ha!”

[He then begins looking around on the ground.]

[Bilbo:] “Where’s the- Where’s the key? Where’s the- it was here…but it was here, it was here! It was just…”

[Bilbo is looking frantically around on the ground in the clearing for the key, suddenly, his foot hits it and it goes flying from the clearing. Just before it falls off the side of the mountain, a boot steps on the string and stops it. It is Thorin. Bilbo sighs in relief. Thorin slowly reaches down and picks up the key, then examines it. The other dwarves step up beside him. They all smile in relief at Bilbo.]



[Thorin inserts the key into the keyhole and turns it; mechanisms are heard turning behind the rock. Thorin pushes the wall, and a previously unseen door opens into the mountain. The seams of the door were completely invisible earlier. The door opens into a tunnel going into the mountain. The dwarves look on it awe as Thorin stands on the threshold.]

[Thorin:] “Erebor.”

[Balin:] “Thorin…”

[Balin chokes up, and Thorin puts a hand on his shoulder. Thorin then steps into the mountain.]

[Thorin:] “I know these walls…these walls, this stone. You remember it, Balin. Chambers filled with golden light.”

[As he says this, Thorin runs his hands over the walls, lost in memory. Balin steps into the tunnel.]

[Balin:] “I remember.”

[The rest of the Company slowly and reverently enters the mountain. Inside, Nori points at a carving in the wall above the door; it is of the throne of Erebor, with the Arkenstone above it, sending out rays of light in all directions. Gloin reads aloud the inscription on the carving.]

[Gloin:] “Herein lies the seventh kingdom of Durin’s Folk. May the heart of the mountain unite all dwarves in defense of this home.”

[Bilbo looks at the carving in interest and curiosity. Balin explains it to him.]

[Balin:] “The throne of the king.”

[Bilbo:] “Oh. And what’s that above it?”

[Balin:] “The Arkenstone.”

[Bilbo:] “Arkenstone….And what’s that?”

[Thorin:] “That, Master Burglar, is why you are here.”  

[All the dwarves look at Bilbo, and he looks bewildered, but resolute.]



[In Bard’s house, Kili is laying on a bed and moaning and straining in pain. His face is covered in sweat.]

[Kili:] “Ah! Ugh! Argh!”

[As he continues moaning, Bofur fills a bowl with hot water and rushes to him.]

[Fili:] “Can you not do something?”

[Oin:] “I need herbs, something to bring down his fever.”

[Bard searches through his bag of medicines.]

[Bard:] “I have nightshade, feverfew…”

[Oin:] “They’re no use to me. Do you have any Kingsfoil?”

[Bard:] “No, it’s a weed. We feed it to the pigs.” 

[Bofur:] “Pigs? Weed? Right.”

[Bofur points at Kili.]

[Bofur:] “Don’t move.”

[Bofur then runs out of the house in search of pigs and Kingsfoil.]



[Balin and Bilbo walk into a tunnel leading to the interior of the mountain.]

[Bilbo:] “You want me to find a jewel?”

[Balin:] “A large white jewel, yes.”

[Bilbo:] “That’s it? Only, I imagine there’s quite a few down there.”

[Balin:] “There is only one Arkenstone. You’ll know it when you see it.”

[Bilbo:] “Alright.”

[Balin begins to walk back down the tunnel, but then pauses.]

[Balin:] “In truth, lad, I do not know what you will find down there. You needn’t go if you don’t want to, there’s no dishonor in turning back.”

[Bilbo:] “No, Balin, I promised I would do this, and I think I must try.”

[Balin looks at Bilbo, then begins to chuckle appreciatively.]

[Balin:] “It never ceases to amaze me.”

[Bilbo:] “What’s that?”

[Balin:] “The courage of Hobbits. Go now with as much luck as you can muster.”

[They nod at each other, and Bilbo proceeds down the tunnel while Balin turns back.]

[Balin:] “Oh, and Bilbo...if there is, in fact, a live dragon down there, don’t waken it.” 

[Bilbo looks worried, but nods. He walks a few more steps, then turns as if to ask a question, but Balin is already disappearing around a corner. Bilbo tiptoes toward Smaug’s lair.]





[In Dol Guldur, it is getting dark, and Gandalf continues searching the ruins. He passes several hanging metal cages full of spikes, each with a skeleton chained inside.]

[Gandalf:] “Cé ná ulco sís nurtaina…I ettuluvas caninye! Cánin i sá tanuvaxe!”

[He walks out onto an open platform and shouts his spell, then strikes his staff against the ground. The concealment-revealing energy bubble expands around him, and it reveals Azog leaping at Gandalf with his mace raised. Gandalf only has the time to raise his sword and staff before Azog strikes him with his mace, sending Gandalf and his weapons flying. Gandalf lies on the ground, and multitudes of now-revealed Orcs stand behind Azog. Azog laughs evily.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: You have come too late, Wizard! It is done.]

[Azog raises his mace and swings to finish Gandalf off, with some of his Orcs running up as well, but Gandalf manages to scramble up with his staff and point it at Azog. The staff causes some sort of invisible barrier which stops Azog in his tracks.]

[Gandalf:] “Where is your master?”

[Azog roars and runs at Gandalf again, but Gandalf’s staff stops him and the Orcs behind him.]

[Gandalf:] “Where is he??”

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: He is everywhere. We are legion!]

[Gandalf backs into the corner of the platform; while holding Azog at bay with his staff, Gandalf looks at the lower lowers of Dol Guldur behind him and sees hordes of Orcs and Wargs below, all armed for war.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: It is over.]

[As Azog raises his mace, Gandalf shouts and swings his staff. There is a blinding flash of light and a thunderclap. When Azog and his Orcs open their eyes, Gandalf has disappeared, but they hear his footsteps running away.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Run him down.]

[Gandalf runs the ruins as Orcs on Wargs chase him. He runs out of a building onto a bridge and strikes the building with his staff, causing parts of it to crumble and fall down, crushing the Wargs on his tail and destroying the bridge.]



[In the distance, Azog roars. Gandalf continues running, and he is running out onto a larger bridge when suddenly, a voice sounds out of the darkness.]

[Necromancer:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: There is no light, Wizard…]

[Gandalf stops short as a massive cloud of shadow appears on the bridge in front of him. It is the Necromancer.]

[Necromancer:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: ...that can defeat darkness.]

[Gandalf raises his staff and forms a protective spherical shield of light around himself, about 60 meters in diameter. Tendrils of shadow try to pierce the shield, but cannot. As the shadow continues pounding at the shield, Gandalf struggles, and the shield grows smaller. Gandalf yells, and the shield grows larger again. However, the shadow grows even stronger, strong enough to disintegrate the bridge in front of Gandalf’s shield. The shield grows smaller and smaller, until it is barely bigger than Gandalf. Gandalf opens his eyes in shock, and his shield completely disappears, and he is pushed back. The shadow rushes at him, but he manages to form his shield again. He falls onto his knees, holding his staff above his head, and the shield continues to grow and shrink. Finally, the shadow pushes so hard that Gandalf’s shield collapses, and he falls back.]



[The shadow turns into a wreath of flames, and Gandalf holds his staff above his head with both hands. The flames turn into the slit pupil of an eye, then slowly take the form of a tall man, wearing armor, and with a helmet shaped like spikes. It is Sauron. As Sauron approaches Gandalf, Gandalf’s staff burns and disintegrates away to nothing. The shadows pick Gandalf up into the air and then slam him down on the stones. They then hurl him into a wall and hold him there. The wall around him crumbles and falls in the presence of Sauron. Sauron looks at Gandalf, and the flames around him seem to explode, forming the Eye of Sauron with his body at the center like an iris. Gandalf, recognizing the Necromancer for what it really is, moans out his name, while his face is covered with burns.]

[Gandalf:] “Sauron.”



[The camera zooms into Sauron’s eye, in which is another flaming eye with Sauron’s body in the middle, and we zoom into this eye, and its eye, and so on. Gandalf is knocked out by the hypnotic illusion.]

 

[Bilbo quietly walks through a large doorway and finds himself in a massive hall. He whispers out loud.]

[Bilbo:] “Hello?”

[He knocks quietly on the wall beside him, but the sound is intensified loudly as it echoes, and he jumps and presses himself against the wall in shock. Seeing no reaction to the noise, he walks out into the hall on an elevated walkway.]

[Bilbo:] “You’re not at home. Not at home. Good. Good, good, good.”

[Bilbo, at the top of a staircase, suddenly stops walking and his mouth hangs open in shock. He sees mountains of gold, jewels, weapons, cups, and all sorts of treasure piled dozens of feet high all throughout the immensely massive hall.]



[Bilbo climbs down the stairs and carefully begins to walk atop the treasure. He tries to be quiet, but the coins and jewels beneath his feet make a lot of noise. He pokes around, looking for the Arkenstone. He finds a large white jewel and examines hit.]

[Bilbo:] “What’s that?”

[He shakes the jewel and continues examining it; deciding that it’s not the Arkenstone, he carelessly throws it aside, then jumps when it clatters and makes a lot of noise.]

[Bilbo:] “Sushh, sushh.”

[He continues to look around.]

[Bilbo:] “Arkenstone, Arkenstone...a large, white jewel. Very helpful.”

[Bilbo is surrounded by so much treasure that it would be impossible for him to find one particular jewel out of all of it.]

[Bilbo climbs up a mountain of gold. He picks up a golden cup, and this action starts a small avalanche of coins. Bilbo looks up and sees the coins falling away to reveal Smaug’s eye, which is shut. Bilbo jumps behind a stone pillar in fright. All is silent, and it seems like Smaug is still asleep. Suddenly, Smaug snorts, and the treasure around his nose falls away, revealing it. Bilbo, panting, slowly tries to make his way down the pile of gold, but stops short when he realizes that Smaug’s body is buried in a large circle around where he is standing. The gold all along Smaug’s body begins to ripple as he awakens.]



[Bilbo takes a few steps, then pauses and kneels as Smaug begins to raise his head, his eye still closed. As Smaug opens his eye, Bilbo runs and dives behind a pile of gold.]

[As Smaug’s eye looks around, Bilbo reaches into his pocket and pulls out the Ring. He looks at it for several seconds, then looks up as Smaug begins to raise his head. He puts the Ring on, and becomes invisible. Smaug raises his head and sniffs the air.]

[Smaug:] “Well, thief, I smell you. I hear your breath. I feel your air. Where are you?”

[As Smaug says this, he moves his head back and forth around the place where Bilbo is invisibly standing, and Bilbo has to duck to avoid being knocked over.]



[Bilbo panics and runs down the mountain of treasure. Even though he is invisible, Smaug can see where he is going because of the coins he’s dislodging with his feet while running. Smaug follows rapidly. Bilbo ducks behind a stone outcropping as Smaug continues searching.]

[Smaug:] “Come now, don’t be shy. Step into the light. Mmm, there is something about you, something you carry. Something made of gold, but far more...PRECIOUSSSSS.”

[While saying this, Smaug’s head is right in front of Bilbo’s hiding place. As Smaug says “Precious,” the word reverberates in Bilbo’s head over and over and he strains in mental pain. A flaming eye bursts into his vision, and he yanks the Ring off, becoming visible to Smaug.]

[Smaug:] “There you are, thief in the shadows.”

[Bilbo:] “I did not come to steal from you, O Smaug the Unassessably Wealthy. I merely wanted to gaze upon your magnificence, to see if you really were as great as the old tales say. I did not believe them.

[Hearing this, Smaug stomps several yards away and draws himself up so his entire body is visible to Bilbo. He is a massive dragon with two back legs,two massive, bat-like wings with claws, and both his neck and tail are incredibly long. His head alone is the size of a school bus.]

[Smaug:] “And, do you you now?!!!”

[Bilbo:] “Truly, the tales and songs fall utterly short of your enormity, O Smaug the Stupendous.”
 
[Smaug:] “Do you think flattery will keep you alive?”

[Bilbo:] “No- no, no.”

[Smaug:] “No, indeed. You seem familiar with my name, but I don’t remember smelling your kind before. Who are you, and where do you come from, may I ask?”

[Smaug snakes his head closer to Bilbo as he asks this. Bilbo opens his mouth to speak but then suddenly sees something off to the side. It is the Arkenstone; a small, white gem glowing with an unnatural light, buried under one layer of coins.]

[Bilbo:] “I- I come from under the hill.”

[Smaug:] “Underhill?”

[Bilbo nods, and sneaks a peek at the Arkenstone. It is not far away from him.]

[Bilbo:] “And under hills and over hills my path has led. And, and, through the air. I am he who walks unseen.”

[Smaug:] “Impressive. What else do you claim to be?”

[Smaug snakes his head forward until his teeth are inches from Bilbo’s face. As Smaug exhales, Bilbo grimaces at his breath.]

[Bilbo:] “I am...luck-wearer. Riddle-maker.”

[Smaug:] “Lovely titles; go on.”

[Bilbo:] “Barrel-rider.”

[Smaug:] “Barrels? Now that is interesting. And what about your little dwarf friends? Where are they hiding?”

[Bilbo:] “Dw- Dwarves? No, no, no dwarves here. You’ve got that all wrong.”

[Smaug:] “Oh, I don’t think so, barrel-rider. They sent you in here to do their dirty work while they skulk about outside.”

[Bilbo:] “Truly, you are mistaken, O Smaug, Chiefest and Greatest of calamities.”

[Smaug:] “You have nice manners...for a thief and a liar! I know the smell and taste of dwarf. No one better. It is the gold! They are drawn to treasure like flies to dead flesh.”

[As Smaug stomps about, his claws knock the Arkenstone away from where it had been, and Bilbo gasps. The Arkenstone bounces down the mountain, and Bilbo runs after it.]

[Smaug:] “Did you think I did not know this day would come, when a pack of canting dwarves would come crawling back to the mountain?!”

[Bilbo trips and slides down the gold. Smaug follows after him, knocking over as massive stone pillar in his rage. As the pillar falls, its reverberations sound throughout the mountain. Even the dwarves sitting in the clearing above the secret stairs hear it and stand up.]

[Dori:] “Was that an earthquake?”

[Balin:] “That, my lad...was a dragon.”

[Thorin looks worried.]



[The reverberation reaches as far as Laketown; in Bard’s house, everyone looks up at the sound, and dust falls from the ceiling. Kili is still moaning in pain.]

[Sigrid:] “Da?”

[Bain:] “It’s coming from the mountain.”

[Fili leaves Kili’s side and approaches Bard.]

[Fili:] “You should leave us. Take your children; get out of here.”

[Bard:] “And go where? There is nowhere to go.”

[Tilda:] “Are we going to die, Da?”

[Bard:] “No, darling.”

[Tilda:] “The dragon, it’s going to kill us.”



[Bard looks at his children worriedly for a moment, then reaches up and pulls a black arrow, the last of the three that Girion had in Dale, from where it had been hidden as a drying rack for plants. His children look at the arrow in shock.]

[Bard:] “Not if I kill it first.”



[Smaug:] “The King under the mountain is dead. I took his throne.”

[Smaug looks for Bilbo, and Bilbo burst out of a pile of gold beneath Smaug’s claw. Bilbo runs down a staircase, and leaps off the side as Smaug’s head swings at him.]  

[Smaug:] “I ate his people like a wolf among sheep.”

[As the Arkenstone bounces rapidly down the mountain of gold, Bilbo slides rapidly after it with Smaug in pursuit.]

[Smaug:] “I kill where I wish, when I wish. My armor is iron.”

[The Arkenstone and Bilbo slide under a covered stone structure; Smaug opens his wings and glides down to land atop the structure.]

[Smaug:] “No blade can pierce me!”



[In Laketown, Bard and Bain sneak through the town. Bard is holding the arrow. Bard look around a corner to check whether all is clear.]

[Bard:] “Alright.”

[Bain:] “A black arrow? Why did you never tell me?”

[Bard:] “Because you did not need to know.”

[They duck behind a wall as soldiers pass by. Bard puts his arm on Bain’s shoulder and indicates the tower with the dwarvish wind-lance on top.]



[Bard:] “Listen to me carefully: I need you to distract the guards. Once I’m at the top of the tower, I’ll set the arrow to the bow.” 

[Just then, Braga and the other soldiers, who have been sent to find Bard, see him]

[Braga:] “There he is! Bard! After him!”

[Bard:] “Quickly! Down there! Go!”

[Bard and Bain run from the soldiers.]

[Braga:] “Stop him!”

[Bard and Bain run through shop and docks, knocking over various items in their way. The soldiers follow, yelling “Stop him!” The shopkeepers yell angrily at both parties. When they have put some distance in front of the guards, Bard stops Bain and hands him the black arrow.]

[Bard:] “Bain! Bain. Keep it safe. Don’t let anyone find it. I’ll deal with them.”

[Bain:] “I won’t leave you!”

[Bard:] “Go!”

[As Bain runs off, Bard turns and faces Braga, who has just caught up to him.]

[Bard:] “Braga.”

[Braga:] “You are under arrest.”

[Bard:] “On what charge?”

[Braga:] “Any charge the Master chooses.”

[Bard turns and sees that he is surrounded. He then turns back and suddenly punches Braga in the face, then punches his way through the soldiers and runs with the soldiers in pursuit. Bain, seeing the soldiers chase his father, jumps into a boat and hides the arrow beneath some ropes and fishing gear.]

[Bard runs through the town; he leaps across a channel using boats as stepping stones. He uses his momentum to cause the last boat to slide several feet across the water until he can step onto the opposite bank. A soldier trying to follow him slips and falls out of a boat into the water. Bard runs down an alley, but a foot is suddenly stuck out of a doorway and Bard trips over it, falling into a pile of wood. As he sits up, dazed, Alfrid steps forward, followed by the Master. As Bard struggles to get up, the Master lifts a wooden pole and hits Bard in the head with it, knocking him out.]



[The dwarves in the clearing on the mountain see an orange glow from the mountain coming through the door.]

[Ori:] “What about Bilbo?”

[Thorin:] “Give him more time.”

[Balin:] “Trying to do what? To be killed?”

[Thorin:] “You’re afraid.”

[Balin pauses for a moment, then steps up to Thorin.]

[Balin:] “Yes, I’m afraid. I fear for YOU. A sickness lies upon that treasure hoard, a sickness that drove your grandfather mad.”

[Thorin:] “I am not my grandfather.”

[Balin:] “You’re not yourself. The Thorin I know would not hesitate to go in there-”

[Thorin:] “I will not risk this quest for the life of one burglar.”

[Balin looks at Thorin disgustedly.]

[Balin:] “Bilbo. His name is Bilbo.”

[Thorin looks contemplatively out into the night.]



[Smaug is searching for Bilbo, who is hiding under the stone structure.]

[Smaug:] “It’s Oakenshield. That filthy dwarvish usurper! He sent you in here for the Arkenstone, didn’t he?”

[Smaug circles around the structure; Bilbo, hiding beneath it, sees the Arkenstone at the other end of the structure.]

[Bilbo:] “No, no, no. I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

[Bilbo starts to sneak over to the Arkenstone, but is forced to hide behind a pillar as Smaug looks beneath the structure.]

[Smaug:] “Don’t bother denying it. I guessed his foul purpose some time ago. But it matters not. Oakenshield’s quest will fail. The darkness is coming, it will spread to every corner of the land.”



[At Dol Guldur, Gandalf wakes up and finds himself trapped in one of the spiked, hanging metal cages he had seen before. He is bloodied, bruised, and burned. Hearing a horn, he looks down and sees legions of Orcs and Wargs march out of Dol Guldur, armed and equipped for war.]



[In Laketown, Bolg and his Orcs sneak around on the rooftops, looking for the dwarves.]

[Bolg:] “Shugi Khozd-shrakhun hum. Nuzdidiz.” [Rough translation: The filthy dwarf rats are somewhere here. I can smell them.]



[Bilbo is still hiding behind a pillar.]

[Smaug:] “You have been used, thief in the shadows. You were only ever a means to an end. The coward Oakenshield has weighed the value of your life and found it worth nothing.”

[Bilbo:] “No. No. No, you’re lying!”

[Smaug:] “What did he promise you? A share of the treasure? As if it was his to give. I will not part with a single coin. Not one piece of it.”

[Bilbo, hearing that Smaug is on top of the structure, seeks the Arkenstone lying a few feet away from the structure and makes a run for it. Smaug sees him and whips his tail, sending Bilbo, the Arkenstone, and gold flying. Bilbo tumbles and lands against a pillar.]

[Smaug:] “My teeth are swords! My claws are spears! My wings are a hurricane!”

[As Smaug displays his wings, Bilbo notices a scale missing on the left side of Smaug’s chest. He whispers to himself.]

[Bilbo:] “So it is true. The black arrow found its mark.”

[Smaug:] “What did you say??”
 
[Bilbo:] “Uh, uh, I was just saying your reputation precedes you, oh Smaug the tyrannical. Truly, you have no equal on this earth.”

[As Bilbo speaks, he slowly backs up. He is standing in a bare, open spot, and Smaug faces him. As he finishes speaking, Bilbo looks down and sees the Arkenstone lying just a few feet from him, and he gazes at it.]

[Smaug:] “I am almost tempted to let you take it, if only to see Oakenshield suffer, watch it destroy him, watch it corrupt his heart and drive him mad.”

[Bilbo and Smaug face off; Bilbo pants. Then Smaug begins to rear his head.]

[Smaug:] “But I think not. I think our little game ends here. So tell me, thief, how do you choose to die?”

[Smaug’s chest glows with a light from inside, and Smaug’s head streaks forward, jaws open, to eat Bilbo. However, Bilbo puts on his ring and disappears, and Smaug’s jaws close on empty space. Angrily, he raises his head again, and the glow from his chest travels up his neck; roaring, Smaug bellows out a massive wall of flames over the area in which  Bilbo had been standing. Unseen by him, coins on the ground move as an invisible Hobbit runs away and up some stairs. Reaching a hallway, Bilbo exhaustedly pulls of the Ring and continues running. Smaug rages about, blowing fire and destroying pillars. His roars echo in the distance.]



[In Laketown, Bard wakes up in a cell. Braga and his soldiers drink and party nearby. Bard rubs his head as he wakes, then jolts upright when he realizes he is in prison.]

[Bofur runs through Laketown, trying to find Kingsfoil. He smells some flowers on a windowsill and rejects them.]

[Bofur:] “Na.”

[As he continues running about, Bolg and other orcs spie him from a rooftop.]

[Orc:] “Khozd!” [translation: Dwarves!]

[Bolg growls softly. Bofur finds a pig eating some weeds; he yanks it out of the pig’s mouth and examines it, then smiles and turns to get back to Kili. Bolg and his Orcs follow on the rooftops.]

[At Bard’s house, Sigrid leans over the balcony outside the front door, looking for her father. She hears a noise and calls out.]

[Sigrid:] “Da? Is that you, Da?”

[She looks around for Bard but doesn’t look up and see Orcs creeping on the roofs of the neighboring houses. Inside, Oin hears a noise on the roof and looks up. As Sigrid turns to walk back inside, an Orc drops on the balcony behind her. She screams and slams the door, but the Orc stops it with his sword. Hearing the screams, Bain, Tilda, and the dwarves jump up.]

[As Bofur hurries toward Bard’s house, an Orcs leaps at him from above. As the Orc swings its axe, Bofur falls backward and drops the Kingsfoil.]

[At the house, another door opens and and Orc strides inside. Oin throws a stack of plates at its head, but another Orc breaks through the roof and falls into the house. The first orc at the door swings at Sigrid, at she falls backward onto the table benches. She slides under the table and pulls the bench sideways next to her as a shield. Fili grapples with an Orc. As another orc falls in through the roof, Tilda throws a plate at it, then Sigrid pulls her under the table as well.]

[Sigrid:] “Get down!”

[An orc threatens Bain, and Bain pushes the bench at it, knocking it over. Bain then grabs the end of the bench and throws it up, hitting the Orc in the head. More orcs jump in through the roof, and one approaches Kili, who is lying in bed.]

[Bofur tries to crawl away, but the Orc grabs him by the legs and pulls him back, then throws him onto a table which tips and causes Bofur to roll away. The orc raises its sword to cut Bofur down, but is suddenly skewered by an arrow through its chest. It falls over dead.]

[In the house, the girls scream as an Orc flips over the table they were hiding under. Another Orc leaps to the balcony in front of the house, but suddenly, Tauriel appears and stabs it in the throat with her knife. She pulls out her other knife as well, and begins killing the Orcs in the house. Legolas jumps in through one of the holes in the roof. He too begins killing Orcs. An Orc approaches Kili and grabs him by the wounded leg. As Kili screams in pain, Tauriel throws her knife and it plunges into the Orc’s throat. Legolas and Tauriel slay Orcs left and right. As an Orc runs at them, Fili grabs Bain and forces him down.]

[Fili:] “Get down!”

[Tauriel kills the Orc, then turns to kill another one. Kili stabs the Orc as well with the knife Tauriel had thrown earlier, and they together kill the Orc. But then, Kili falls over onto the floor, howling in pain, and Tauriel looks at him in worry.]

[An Orc, Bolg’s lieutenant, flees from the house and jumps over the balcony, landing in a boat in the water below. He yells to Bolg, who is striding toward the house.]

[Orc:] “Ekinskeld. Obguranid!” [Subtitle: Oakenshield has gone!]

[Bolg:] “Gur! Arangim!” [Subtitle: Fall back! Regroup at the bridge!]

[The remaining Orcs join him.]

[In the house, Legolas stabs an Orc and trips it, and it falls backward over the balcony railing and lands in the boat below. The boat acts like a seesaw and sends Bolg’s lieutenant orc, who had jumped into the boat earlier, flying up into the air, where Legolas slices off its head with his knives. As the orc’s body falls into the water below, its head still looks at Legolas. Legolas releases the head and it falls. Legolas looks and sees the remaining Orcs running through Laketown after Bolg.]



[Bofur dazedly gets up and sees the Kingsfoil lying in front of him.]

[In the house, Bain speaks to Tauriel amazedly.]

[Bain:] “You killed them all.”

[Legolas:] “There are others. Tauriel, come.”

[Legolas strides toward the door. Tauriel, who had been looking after Kili, looks up. Kili is on the ground, and Oin examines him.]

[Oin:] “We’re losing him!”

[Tauriel, looking shocked, looks at Kili, then at Legolas, who is waiting at the door.]

[Legolas:] “Tauriel.”

[Legolas looks at her for a moment and then walks out the door. Tauriel remains standing. Legolas jumps over the balcony and onto a bridge, then begins running. Tauriel looks away and begins to head out the door to follow Legolas. Just as she reaches the door, Kili moans in pain, and Tauriel turns to look at him. Legolas catches up to the Orcs and shoots one at point blank; the arrow goes all the way through its head and into the wood planking behind. Tauriel looks after Legolas, then at Kili again. Hearing a noise, Tauriel grabs her knives, then sees Bofur running up with the Kingsfoil. Her eyes open in shock and she takes the leaves from Bofur’s stunned grasp.]

[Tauriel:] “Athelas.”

[She reverently examines it.]

[Tauriel:] “Athelas…”

[Bofur:] “What are you doing…?”

[Tauriel:] “I’m going to save him.”



[In the mountain, Thorin has decided to save Bilbo. He charges with his sword out through the tunnels, and stops as flames light up the walls of the tunnel. He runs out onto the same overhang Bilbo had earlier reached, then stops abruptly when he sees the mountain of treasure all around him. He breathes heavily. Just then, Bilbo runs up to him.]

[Thorin:] “You’re alive!”

[Bilbo:] “Not for much longer!”

[Thorin:] “Did you find the Arkenstone?”

[Bilbo:] “The dragon’s coming!”

[Thorin:] “The Arkenstone!”

[They are both standing at the entrance to the tunnel, but Thorin is blocking Bilbo’s way. They pause and look at each other for several seconds, then Thorin speaks again, more quietly.]

[Thorin:] “Did you find it?”

[They stare at each other for several seconds, panting heavily.]

[Bilbo:] “No. We have to get out.”

[Bilbo tries to enter the tunnel, but Thorin swings his sword across it, blocking the entrance. He presses the blade against Bilbo, and Bilbo stumbles back, the sword still touching him. Bilbo and Thorin face each other, with the tip of Thorin’s sword against Bilbo’s chest.]

[Bilbo:] “Thorin. Thorin!”

[Thorin steps forward, forcing Bilbo to step back. Bilbo’s eyes are open in fear, and Thorin’s face is steel and blank of emotion. Suddenly, Bilbo looks off to the side, and Thorin hears a sound in that direction. He turns and sees Smaug approaching over the mountain of treasure. Smaug, recognizing Thorin, snarls. Suddenly, the remaining dwarves run out of the tunnel and face Smaug, their weapons out. Smaug roars and rushes at them; his chest and neck glow orange.]

[Smaug:] “You will burn!”

[Just as Smaug bellows fire at them, the dwarves and Bilbo turn and jump off the staircase. They tumble down the pile of treasure and land near the entrance to another tunnel, which they run into.]

[Dori:] “Come on, Bilbo!”

[Angrily, Smaug breathes fire in all directions. Thorin, the last one in the door, is pushed in by the force of the flames. He runs into the room at the other end of the tunnel with the back of his coat on fire, and he throws himself on the ground and rolls to extinguish the flames. He jumps back up.]

[Thorin:] “Come on.”

[With Smaug roaring in the background, they run.]



[At Bard’s house, Tauriel washes and tears apart the Kingsfoil in a tub of water held by Tilda. Fili, Oin, and Bofur pick up a moaning Kili and lay him on the table and try to hold him down.]

[Tauriel:] “Hold him down.”

[She approaches with the bowl of water and examines Kili’s wound. Seeing how black and festered it is, she looks away in worry. As the others look on, Tauriel closes her eyes and begins chanting in Elvish while she kneads the soaked Kingsfoil in her hand, then presses it to Kili’s wound.]

[Tauriel:] “Menno o nin na hon i eliad annen annin, hon leitho o ngurth.” [Rough translation: May the blessing that was given to me be sent from me to him, may he be released from death.]

[Kili screams and thrashes in pain, and Sigrid jumps in to help hold him down. She calls her sister to come help as well.]

[Sigrid:] “Tilda!”

[Tauriel continues chanting; Fili looks at her strangely, and Oin listens in amazement through his fairly dented hearing trumpet. Kili begins calming down. In his hearing, it seems as though Tauriel’s voice has become echoing and all-encompassing. To his vision, she appears to start glowing like a star. He stares at her, glassy-eyed.]



[In Erebor, everything is quiet and dark. There is no sign of either the dragon or the dwarves. Suddenly, there are footsteps. The dwarves emerge out of a tunnel and approach a stone bridge over a chasm. Thorin raises his hand and quiets the group.]

[Thorin:] “Shh. Shh.”

[Dori:] “Quiet.”

[They near the foot of the bridge and Thorin peers around the edge of the tunnel, looking for any sign of Smaug. They all whisper.]

[Dori:] “We’ve given him the slip.”

[Dwalin:] “No, he’s too cunning for that.”

[Bilbo:] “So where to now?”

[Thorin:] “The western guardroom. There may be a way out.”

[Balin:] “It’s too high. There’s no chance that way.”

[Thorin:] “It’s our only chance. We have to try.”

[Quietly, they tiptoe across the bridge, looking all about. Suddenly, a coin falls to the floor right in front of Bilbo and rings loudly. They all freeze and look at Bilbo, who frantically checks his jacket to see if some coin had been stuck in a fold. Hearing another coin fall, they look up and see Smaug crawling just above them, looking for them. He hasn’t seen them. The coins that fell came from his chest and arms, where several coins and gems have embedded themselves after years of him sleeping on them. Thorin motions for them to keep moving.]



[At Bard’s house, Tauriel binds Kili’s leg with a clean cloth. Kili lies on the table with his head in a basket of walnuts. Oin and Fili are in the kitchen, watching a pot of water boil.]

[Oin:] “I’ve heard tell of the wonders of elvish medicine. That was a privilege to witness.”

[Kili slightly opens his eyes and looks at Tauriel.]

[Kili:] “Tauriel.”

[Tauriel:] “Lie still.”

[Kili:] “You cannot be her.”

[Tauriel looks up in confusion.]

[Kili:] “She is far away. Sh- She is far, far away from me, and she walks in starlight in another world.”

[Tauriel looks at Kili.]

[Kili:] “It was just a dream.”

[Kili slowly raises his hand and entwines his fingers with Tauriel’s.]

[Kili:] “Do you think she could have loved me?”

[Tauriel is silent for a few moments, then opens her mouth to speak, but the scene cuts before she says anything.]



[In Erebor, the Company runs through a hall and emerge in the western guardroom.]

[Thorin:] “Stay close.”

[They all stop abruptly when they see that the guardroom is full of rotted, dust- and cobweb-covered corpses.]

[Dwalin:] “That’s it, then. There’s no way out.”

[It seems like a landslide or something has blocked the exit, trapping the dwarves in the past in the room to die.]

[Balin:] “The last of our kin. They must have come here, hoping beyond hope. We could try to reach the Mines. We might last a few days.”

[Thorin:] “No. I will not die like this. Cowering, clawing for breath. We make for the forges.”

[Dwalin:] “He’ll see us, sure as death.”

[Thorin:] “Not if we split up.”

[Balin:] “Thorin, we’ll never make it.”

[Thorin:] “Some of us might. Lead him to the forges. We kill the dragon. If this is to end in fire, then we will all burn together.”

[Thorin, Bilbo, and Balin run out onto the bridge from earlier.]

[Thorin:] “This way!”

[A booming sound comes from nearby, and Smaug appears.]

[Smaug:] “Flee, flee! Run for your lives! There is nowhere to hide.”

[Smaug goes at the three, but he turns at another sound. Dori, Ori, and Bombur are running on another bridge and yelling to distract Smaug.]

[Dori:] “Behind you!”

[Smaug looks at them, then lunges toward them. They turn and run.]

[Dori:] “Come on!”

[As Smaug chases the second group (Dori, Ori, and Bombur), the first group (Thorin, Bilbo, and Balin) continue across the bridge. Suddenly, the third group, Dwalin and Nori, run across another bridge and yell to distract Smaug.]

[Dwalin:] “Hey you! Here!”

[Smaug turns and jumps at them. They run off the bridge and into a tunnel just before Smaug’s claw lands where they were. The fourth group, Gloin and Bifur, use this chance to run across a bridge and make it into a tunnel as well. Angrily, Smaug blows fire after them. He blows rapidly in an arc all around him, into all the tunnels. His fire causes the stones beneath Gloin and Bifur to glow in heat. They reach a cliff and leap into the air, landing in large troughs which they slide down. They land in the buckets of a large hanging conveyor belt system used in the past for mining.]



[In Laketown, Bolg strides across a bridge and issues a command to his Orcs and Wargs who are waiting there.]

[Bolg:] “Zidgar Guldur-nar! Ekinskeld Erebor-nar nakhan!” [Subtitle: Send word to Dol Guldur! Oakenshield has reached the Mountain!]

[Bolg and the Orcs turn when they hear the sound of steel and fighting in the town behind them.]

[The sounds are coming from Legolas, who is still pursuing the Orcs and killing them with his knives.]

[Bolg turns back to the Orcs.]

[Bolg:] “Gur! Abguriz!” [Subtitle: Go! You! Come with me.]

[As the Orcs turn to leave, Bolg and two Orcs stride back toward the town. The remaining Orcs and Wargs gallop across a long bridge connecting Laketown to the mainland.]

[Bolg steps into a long alley just as Legolas enters it from the other side. They glare at each other, and Legolas whips out Orcrist, which he has been carrying at his hip. Holding it in both hands, he advances toward Bolg.]



[As they walk toward each other, the other two Orcs appear out of hiding spots on either side of the alley and attack Legolas. Legolas knocks the two of them down just in time to deflect a blow from Bolg. Legolas fights all three Orcs at once, and when he has knocked down the two again, he stabs at Bolg’s stomach, but Bolg drops his weapon and catches Legolas’s sword between his arm and ribs. He pulls Legolas closer to him using the sword and then throws him against a wooden pillar. Legolas drops the sword. Before he can get up, Bolg grabs him and throws him again, this time into a wall. Bolg strides over and kicks at Legolas, but Legolas manages to grab Bolg’s leg and knock him off balance and into the wall behind him. Legolas leaps in the air and delivers a flying punch to Bolg’s face. He grab’s Bolg and smashes his head repeatedly into the wooden post. He throws Bolg against a wall, but Bolg rebound from the wall and grabs Legolas in a crushing embrace against his chest. He squeezes Legolas and Legolas strains in pain, then jerks his head back into Bolg’s face, forcing him to release him. Legolas manages to pull out a knife and slice Bolg lightly on the stomach, but Bolg grabs him and throws him toward the other two Orcs, who have gotten back up. As Legolas fights the two of them with his knife, Bolg strides away, limping.]

[Legolas dispatches the two Orcs and runs over to where Orcrist is lying on the ground, and he picks it up. As he stands, he falls back against a wall in pain, breathing heavily. His eyes open wide in shock and he raises his hand to his nose. It comes away with blood, and he is shocked. He looks to the side and sees Bolg on a Warg, heading out of the town.]

[Bolg rides across the bridge on his Warg; close behind him is Legolas on a white horse.]



[Balin, Thorin, and Bilbo run through a large hallway. Balin turns into a side tunnel, but Thorin continues forward with Bilbo at his heels.]

[Balin:] “It’s this way! This way! Come on!”

[Bilbo stops by the tunnel, and calls out to Thorin, who is still ahead.]

[Bilbo:] “Thorin!”

[Thorin turns and begins to go back to Bilbo and Balin, but stops suddenly. They all see Smaug at the end of the hallway. Thorin yells at Bilbo.]

[Thorin:] “Follow Balin!”

[Bilbo:] “Thorin!”

[Balin:] “Come on!”

[Balin pulls Bilbo into the side tunnel just as Smaug’s chest glows orange and he unleashes his fire throughout the hall. Thorin runs the other way and leaps into the air, falling into a deep pit. He catches onto a chain with a bucket at the end of it, and it begins descending just as Smaug leaps into the pit as well. Smaug claws his way down the tunnel, snapping at Thorin on the chain. Dwalin runs up to the mouth of the pit.]

[Dwalin:] “Thorin!”

[Dwalin smashes his axe into the machinery holding the chain Thorin is holding on to, and the chain stops descending abruptly. Beside Dwalin, a heavy holding bucket on the other end of the same chain begins descending rapidly, causing Thorin’s chain to fly upward. Thorin soars upward, narrowly missing Smaug’s head. Smaug turns and manages to grab the end of Thorin’s chain, stopping its movement. Smaug pulls down, at the machinery holding the chain at the top of the pit breaks free of its moorings and falls into the pit. Hit chain slack, Thorin falls and lands right on the tip of Smaug’s closed mouth. He stands on Smaug’s top lip as Smaug growls and opens his mouth; fire is visibly rising up his neck. Just as Smaug snaps closed his mouth to eat Thorin, Thorin leaps to the side and grabs another chain. Smaug turns to bite him, but the falling machinery strikes him in the face. Nori, at the top of the pit, hits another machine, and its gears spin rapidly, pulling Thorin on his chain rapidly upward. Smaug roars and blows smoke straight up the pit after Thorin. Thorin manages to reach the top and throw himself on a ledge just as the fire erupts beside him. He stumbles over to Nori.]

[Thorin:] “Go! Go!”

[Thorin and Nori run through narrow slits between tall, stone pillars and join the other dwarves and Bilbo. They are standing in front of several massive dwarf furnaces, each at least 10 yards high.]

[Dwalin:] “The plan’s not going to work. These furnaces are stone cold.”

[Balin:] “He’s right; there’s no fire hot enough to set them ablaze.”

[The furnaces are all dark, with no sign of fire within. Thorin turns back toward the pit.]

[Thorin:] “Have we not? I did not look to see you so easily outwitted!”

[Smaug’s claw emerges from the pit, his body following it. Thorin continues taunting him.]

[Thorin:] “You have grown slow and fat in your dotage.”

[Smaug snarls at Thorin in anger.]

[Thorin:] “Slug.”

[As Smaug snarls and advances, Thorin gets behind a pillar and yells to the others to do the same.]

[Thorin:] “Take cover. Go!”

[They all rush behind pillars just as Smaug unleashes his flame at them. The fire goes past the pillars and reaches all the way to the furnaces. The dwarves and Bilbo, though not in the direct path of the fire, yell from the pain, heat, and pressure. As Smaug stops, fire suddenly comes out of the bottoms of the furnaces, and they begin glowing and working. Smaug growls in confusion and anger. The dwarves run from the pillars as Smaug begins battering at them with his head. They are immensely strong, like a latticework of metal, but they begin to bend under Smaug’s tremendous strength.]

[Thorin:] “Bombur! Get those bellows working. Go!”

[Bombur:] “Alright!”

[Bombur runs and leaps onto a chain next to a forge. The chain slides down with his weight, and he lands on the handle of a massive bellows. The bellows compress and blast air into the furnace, which exhumes bright blue flames. On top of the furnaces is a massive pile of unrefined gold, at least 10 yards in diameter.]

[Thorin turns and sees the latticework continue to bend from Smaug’s bashing.]

[Thorin:] “Bilbo! Up there, on my mark, pull that lever.”

[He points Bilbo toward a lever high up on a mound, and Bilbo runs toward it. The dwarves run toward the forges as the latticework begins to break. Thorin grabs Balin.]

[Thorin:] “Balin, can you still make some flash-flame?”

[Balin:] “Aye. It’ll only take a jiffy.” 

[Balin grabs some of the other dwarves to help him.]

[Balin:] “Come on!”

[As Balin runs off, Dwalin looks at the latticework, which is bending dangerously from Smaug’s blows.]

[Dwalin:] “We don’t have a jiffy.”

[Under the force of Smaug’s onslaught, the latticework finally gives way and falls to the ground. Smaug storms into the furnace room. He looks about, growling.]





[In a storage room nearby, Balin and some other dwarves frantically mix together various powders into jars to make flash-flame bombs.]

[Balin:] “Where’s the sulfur?” 

[Dori:] “You sure you know what you’re doing?”



[Bilbo clambers up some steps and reaches the lever mounted high on a tower; Smaug begins walking toward him.]

[Balin chuckles as he pours a vial of powder into empty jars.]

[Dori:] “Come on!”

[Smaug walks toward Bilbo.]

[Balin drops some small ball into each jar.]

[Smaug raises his head to look at Bilbo, then looks to the side and sees Thorin standing there. Smaug turns and snarls at Thorin, and Thorin yells to Bilbo.]

[Thorin:] “Now!”

[Bilbo jumps into the air and pulls down on the lever just as Thorin lunges toward Thorin. Huge jets of water burst out of carved faces in the wall behind Bilbo and slam into Smaug, knocking him off balance and quenching the flames he was beginning to blow at Thorin. Smaug slides into the side of a furnace from the force of the water, and the glow in his chest disappears. Roaring in rage, Smaug flaps into the air and begins thrashing about madly. The jets of water cause a watermill to begin turning some gears, which causes the various rope conveyor belts to begin operating. Some of them are full of heavy chunks of rock and ore.]

[Bombur continues going up and down on his chain, pumping the bellows and turning the furnace fire blue. Atop the furnaces, the solid impure gold begins to glow and melt. Smaug begins crawling toward Thorin again. Above him, Gloin and Bifur have arrived on the bucket conveyor belt. As Bilbo begins to climb down the mound, Smaug approaches Thorin. Suddenly, there is a flash of blue light on the side of his head. Balin, Ori, and Dori are throwing flash-flame bombs at Smaug. However, Smaug is not at all fazed by them and continues toward Thorin. Above Smaug, Gloin raises his axe and cuts the rope of the conveyor belt full of heavy rocks below him, dropping tons of rocks on Smaug and making him fall to the ground, roaring.]

[The gold atop the furnaces is completely melted now. Thorin runs over to a furnace and pulls on a chain, opening a gate which allows the molten gold to flow out of the furnaces and through troughs built into the ground.]

[Smaug, tangled in the ropes of the conveyor belt, thrashes about and hits the rope of the conveyor belt Gloin and Bifur are in, breaking it and knocking it to the floor.]

[Gloin:] “Noo! Ahhh!”

[They miraculously land on the ground unhurt. Beneath Smaug, rivers of molten gold flow through the troughs on the floor. Thorin turns and begins running, shouting back at the dwarves.]

[Thorin:] “Lead him to the Gallery of the Kings!” 

[As Smaug thrashes about, one of the heavy metal buckets tangled on him goes flying toward Bilbo on top of the mound. Bilbo yells and ducks, and the bucket misses him but takes large chunks out of the wall.]

[Thorin grabs a wheelbarrow and runs while pushing it, dodging Smaug’s thrashing limbs. Smaug’s tail smashes into the base of the mound, cracking it and worrying Bilbo. Thorin throws the wheelbarrow into a channel of gold and leaps into the wheelbarrow; it floats on the gold and is carried along. Seeing this, Smaug roars and whips his head around, finally getting rid of the ropes and buckets tangled around him. He stomps over to a small entrance at the base of the mound where all the troughs of liquid gold join and lead out of the room. Before he can get to Thorin, Thorin on his wheelbarrow floats through the entrance, just as the mound collapses and Bilbo falls. He manages to hit the ground rolling. Smaug sees Bilbo and snarls. Thorin turns his head back and yells.]

[Thorin:] “Keep going, Bilbo! Run!”

[Bilbo takes off running with Smaug in pursuit; he leaps onto a large stone slide before Smaug can grab him, and Smaug slides after him, demolishing all the stone structures nearby with his wings.]

[The trough Thorin is floating in ends at a drop; as his wheelbarrow goes over the edge, Thorin leaps from it and grabs onto a chain. The molten gold drops into a large stone mold.]



[Bilbo, running from Smaug, runs through a doorway and into a massive hall adorned with banners hundreds of feet tall.]



[Just as he runs in, the wall above the doorway explodes as Smaug jumps through it. Bilbo runs frantically from the flying rocks, but is caught beneath the cloth of a falling banner and knocked to the floor. Smaug leaps to the floor and shouts angrily.]

[Smaug:] “You think you could deceive me, Barrel-rider?”

[Bilbo peaks out from the edge of the banner.]

[Smaug:] “You have come from Laketown. There is- is some sort of scheme hatched between these filthy dwarves and those miserable cup-trading Lakemen. Those sniveling cowards with their longbows and black arrows!”

[Smaug is talking to himself, and his voice breaks in both anger and fear when he mentions the black arrows.]

[Smaug:] “Perhaps it is time I paid them a visit.”

[Smaug turns to go to Laketown, and Bilbo gasps.]

[Bilbo:] “Oh, no.”

[He scrambles out from under the banner and yells at Smaug.]

[Bilbo:] “This isn’t their fault! Wait! You cannot go to Laketown.”

[Hearing this, Smaug stops for a moment, then turns toward Bilbo, who is running after him.]

[Smaug:] “You care about them, do you? Good. Then you can watch them die.”

[Smaug turns and strides off down the hall. Suddenly, a voice sounds from one end of the hall, where there is a massive stone structure that looks roughly like a dwarf. The voice is Thorin’s; he is standing atop the structure.]

[Thorin:] “Here, you witless worm!”

[Smaug stops in his track, snarling and squinting in anger. He then turns toward Thorin.]

[Smaug:] “You.”

[Thorin:] “I am taking back what you stole.”

[Smaug slowly stalks toward Thorin.]

[Smaug:] “You would take nothing from me, Dwarf. I laid low your warriors of old. I instilled terror in the hearts of men. I am King under the Mountain.”

[His head is level with Thorin now; Bilbo watches from an adjoining hall.]

[Thorin:] “This is not your kingdom. These are dwarf lands, this is dwarf gold, and we will have our revenge.”

[Unseen by Smaug, there are chains attached to various places on the back of the stone dwarf structure Thorin is standing on, and the ends of these chains are held by the other dwarves. As Thorin speaks, Smaug’s chest and neck glow with fire, and Thorin slowly reaches up toward a rope above him. Just as Smaug opens his mouth, Thorin yells something in Khuzdul.]

[Thorin:] “_ _ _” 

[Thorin yanks on the rope, and a pin behind the stone falls out, releasing heavy wooden bands and chains that had been wrapped tightly around the stone. Smaug rears his head in confusion. The other dwarves pull mightily on their chains, and more pins similar to the first are pulled out of the stone. The stone structure, which is now revealed to be the mold into which the liquid gold from earlier poured into, falls apart and reveals a massive statue of a dwarf king, made entirely out of solid gold. Thorin swings away on a rope to escape the falling rocks. Smaug looks at the golden statue, which is even larger than him, in awe and desire. As he approaches it, his mouth opens slightly in greed.]



[Suddenly, the gold around the statue’s eyes warps and then explodes into liquid; the gold in the statue had not yet fully solidified, and the entire statue collapses and explodes into burning hot liquid. Smaug roars in anger as the statue melts, and scrabbles backward to escape the gold. However, he cannot move fast enough and the tidal wave of gold hits him and knocks him over. As he roars, he is entirely smothered and drowned in the gold, which fills the entire hall in a layer several feet deep.]

[The gold settles, and no sign of Smaug is seen. The dwarves begin to smile in joy, but suddenly, the surface of the golden lake explodes as Smaug leaps out. He is entirely covered in gold, and he screams in anger and pain.]

[Smaug:] “Ahh! Revenge?! Revenge! I will show you REVENGE!”

[As the dwarves and Bilbo look on in shock, Smaug runs down the hallway and takes off in flight.]

[Outside the mountain, it is night; we see the great doors of Erebor closed and shut. Suddenly, the side of the mountain breaks as an enraged Smaug smashes his way out. He flaps his wing and lifts off into the sky, spinning and causing the remaining gold on him to fall off in a golden shimmer. He swoops off toward Laketown.]



[In Laketown, people see the fire and light coming from the previously closed gates of Erebor, and they shout and cower in fear. Bard grabs the bars of his cell in shock. In Bard’s house, the dwarves, children, and Tauriel look about in fear.]



[Bilbo runs out of the destroyed gates of Erebor and climbs up some ruins, looking after the flying Smaug. He falls to his knees.]



[Bard yells to Braga and the soldiers, who are partying in their barracks nearby, but they ignore him.]

[Bard:] “Listen to me! You don’t know what is coming!” 



[Smaug soars through the air toward Laketown, talking to himself.]

[Smaug:] “I am fire. I am...DEATH!”



[Watching him fly away, Bilbo despairingly pants and looks on in shock.]

[Bilbo:] “What have we done?”

[The scene fades to black. As the credits roll, Ed Sheeran’s song “I See Fire” plays.]

The Hobbit




[Opening scene: We see Laketown, with the Lonely Mountain in the distance. Bells are ringing, and people are frantically loading their possessions into boats. In his house, the Master of Laketown is overseeing his soldiers and servants carrying boxes containing his gold and valuables.]

[Master:] “I warned you. Did I not warn you what would come of dealing with dwarves?! Now they’ve done it! They’ve woken the dragon. They brought the apocalypse upon our heads! Come on! Quickly! Quickly!”

[The Master pulls a candlestick in the wall sideways; it turns out to be a secret lever, and a nearby bookshelf falls backward to reveal a hidden staircase and boat landing with the Master’s boat waiting.]

[Master:] “Faster now! I’m trying to evacuate myself here! Careful, men. Never mind the books! Get on, get the rest of it!”

[Guard #1:] “But Sire, should we not try to save the town?”

[Master:] “The town is lost! Save the gold!”

[Guard #2:] “You heard him.”

[The men load all the gold and other valuables onto the Master’s boat.]



[The townspeople frantically paddle their loaded boats through the canals. Tauriel watches the sky ominously; with her elf-hearing, she can hear Smaug approaching and roaring. Suddenly, a huge shadow swoops overhead. Smaug has arrived.]

[Tauriel enter’s Bard’s house and prepares the dwarves and Bard’s family to leave.]

[Tauriel:] “We have no time. We must leave!”

[Bofur:] “Get him up.”

[Fili:] “Come on, brother.”

[Bofur:] “Come on, come on! Let’s go.”

[Kili:] “I’m fine - I can walk.”

[Tauriel:] “As fast as you can.”

[Bain:] “We’re not leaving. Not without our father.”

[Tauriel:] “If you stay here, your sisters will die. Is that what your father would want?”



[Bard is in the prison, and all the men guarding him are gone. He clutches the cell bars and shouts.]

[Bard:] “Open the door! Do you hear me!”

[He stops as he sees Smaug flying high above the town, then frantically tries to break the lock. When it doesn’t break, he rushes to the other side of his jail cell, which is on an arch of a building overhanging a canal.] 



[Tauriel, the dwarves, and Bard’s family get on a boat at the back of the house.] 

[Fili:] “Give me your hand.”

[Bofur:] “Come on, we gotta go!”

[Tauriel:] “Quickly now! Hurry!”

[Fili:] “Kili, come on!”

[They set off down the canal, poling the boat through the floating chunks of ice. Smaug swoops low overhead, and the townspeople scream.]

[Smaug soars high above and away from the town, then turns and dives steeply toward the town, building up fire in his chest.] 



[As he gets over the town, he unleashes his flames, and he breathes his fire in a line all the way across the town. People scream and fall and die in the inferno.]

[Bard smashes at his cell’s bars with a pail, but to no avail.]

[Smaug breathes fire over another section of the town; a man, on fire, falls out of his house and into the water.]



[The Master, his men, and Alfrid pole their boat loaded with treasure through the water, with Smaug setting things to fire around them.]

[Master:] “Come on! Come on! Faster! FASTER!”



[Master:] “If only we could take more of these poor people with us, but they are hardly-”

[Alfrid:] “-worth it. I quite agree.”

[A man tries to climb onto the boat, but Alfrid kicks him in the face and back into the water.]



[Bard tears his blanket into strips. People are trampling each other in their efforts to escape the dragon and the fire.]

[Bain:] “Look out!”

[The Master’s boat collides with Tauriel’s, upsetting everyone. They manage to push their boats apart, but some of the Master’s treasure falls into the water.]

[Master:] “Move it! Move it! Come on, faster!” 

[Master:] “My gold, my GOLD!”

[Alfrid:] “We’re carrying too much weight. We need to dump something!”

[While Alfrid looks at the pile of treasure, trying to decide what to throw overboard, the Master looks at him greedily.]

[Master:] “You’re quite right, Alfrid.”

[The Master pushes Alfrid overboard, just as a cloth loops falls from above and catches around the Master’s throat. It is the rope Bard made from his blanket; he has tied one end to his cell bars and let the other end, the loop, out of the window and over the canal, where it has conveniently caught the Master. Braga, at the front of the boat, hasn’t seen this.]

[Braga:] “Faster! Faster!”

[As the boat pulls ahead, the rope loops pulls the Master back, but then he gets stuck in front of the boat’s rear post. As the rope tightens around him, he gags and chokes. Eventually, the pressure is so much that the entire side of Bard’s prison break, and Bard escapes. The Master frantically pulls the rope away from his throat.]

[As Smaug flies overhead, still blowing flames, Bard breaks through the guardroom window and grabs his bow and quiver, testing his bowstring. He pushes out some of the shingles in the upper story and clambers out onto the roof, where he has a good vantage point. He ducks low as Smaug flies by almost overhead. Bard runs across the rooftops, heading toward the bell tower, the tallest building in the town.]



[Back at the Lonely Mountain, Thorin and Company watch the town burning in the lake.]

[Balin:] “Poor souls.”

[They all stare at each other in sadness and fear. Bilbo looks back and sees that Thorin is staring back at the halls of Erebor, not at Laketown. Bilbo looks worried.]





[Bard continues leaping roof to roof. Tauriel hides her boat under an overhang until she sees that it’s safe to go on.]



[Bard climbs rapidly up the winding steps of the bell tower. Once at the top, he pulls all the arrows out of his quiver and looks out at the sky. As Smaug soars by, Bard shoots an arrow at him; however, the arrow merely bounces off Smaug’s scales and falls to the ground. Bard, standing directly below the ringing bell, gets nauseated by the booming sound, so he pulls out his dagger and cut’s the bell’s rope, silencing it. He shoots another arrow at Smaug, but this, like the first bounces harmlessly off. In the canals below, Bain, on the boat with his family, the dwarves, and Tauriel, notices his father at the top of the tower.]



[Bain:] “Da!”

[Tilda:] “DA!”

[As they watch, Bard shoots yet another arrow, harmlessly hitting the dragon.]

[Kili:] “He hit it! He hit the dragon!”

[Tauriel:] “No...”

[Kili:] “He did! He hit his mark, I saw!”

[Tauriel:] “His arrows cannot pierce its hide; I fear nothing will.”

[Bain looks down disconsolately, then suddenly looks up and notices the state of the Master of Laketown, and below it, the boat in which he’d hidden the Black Arrow his father had asked him to keep safe. Bain’s face turns to a determined look. As their boat passes under a hanging hook, Bain leaps up and grabs it, swinging clear of the boat. The other grab at him and miss, and they yell after him.]

[Bofur:] “What are you doing?!”

[Fili:] “Come back! Bain, come back!”

[Bain uses the hook and the crane it is attached to to swing to the dock, from where he runs toward the boat with the Black Arrow.]

[Tauriel:] “Leave him! We cannot go back!”

[Tilda:] “Bain!”



[At the top of the tower, Bard reaches for his arrows, only to find one left. He hesitates in fear, then grabs it and shoots Smaug. This time, Smaug passes so close to the tower that the wind knocks Bard over. Smaug howls, feeling the arrow, although it didn’t hurt him. Suddenly, Bain appears at the top of the bell tower, shocking Bard.]

[Bain:] “Dad!”

[Bard:] “Bain?! What are you doing?! Why didn’t you leave?! You were supposed to leave!”

[Bain:] “I came to help you.”

[Bard:] “No! Nothing can stop him now!”

[Bain:] “This might.”

[Bain holds up the Black Arrow. His father gratefully looks at it, then stroke’s Bain’s face.]

[Bard:] “Bain - you go back. You get out of here now!”

[Looking beyond Bard, Bain sees Smaug approaching the tower rapidly, Smaug having determined where the arrows were coming from.]

[Bain:] “DAD!”

[Smaug smashes through the top part of the bell tower. Bard finds himself lying down on the remaining top of the tower.]

[Bard:] “BAIN!”

[Bain is hanging by one arm to the remains of the tower; he has the Black Arrow in the other. Bard grabs Bain’s arm and hauls him back up. Meanwhile, Smaug lands closeby in the town, crushing buildings underneath him. He is directly in the way of the Master’s boat.]

[Master:] “Stop! Stop! Halt! Halt!”

[Bard pulls the Black Arrow out of the hands of the petrified Bain and stands up, facing Smaug. Smaug looks at him.] 

[Smaug:] “Who are you that would stand against me?!”

[Bard grabs his bow, only to find that it was broken in half when Smaug smashed into the tower earlier.]

[Smaug:] “Now that is a pity. What will you do now, Bowman? You are forsaken. No help will come.”



[Bard looks around frantically, but there is nothing to help him. Smaug begins walking toward him, crushing the buildings beneath him. The Master sees his chance and yells to his oarsmen.]

[Master:] “Now’s our chance! Go! Go! Into the open water!”

[Looking at the tower, Smaug growls and licks his lips. He continues speaking to Bard.]

[Smaug:] “Is that your child? You cannot save him from the fire. He will BURN!”

[As Smaug continues to approach, Bard fixes the two broken halves of his bow into the walls of the belltower, with the bowstring taut between them. He fixes the Black Arrow to the bowstring, and lays the front end of the Black Arrow on the shoulder of Bain, who is standing in between the fixed pieces of the bow and facing Bard. Bain pants in fear since he can hear Smaug approaching from behind him, but can’t see him.]

[Bard:] “Stay still, son. Stay still.”

[Smaug:] “Tell me, wretch - How now shall you challenge me?!”

[Bard notices a missing scale on Smaug’s chest, the scale that was broken by Girion, Lord of Dale. A small smile crosses Bard’s face.]

[Smaug:] “You have nothing left, but your DEATH!”

[Smaug howls, approaching more rapidly. Bain looks over his shoulder at the dragon, but Bard calls him back.]

[Bard:] “Bain! Look at me. You look at me.”

[Bard strains with the effort of holding the Black Arrow taut.]

[Bard:] “A little to your left.”

[Bain shifts a little to his left, moving the tip of the arrow to the right, toward the spot where Bard noticed the missing scale on Smaug.]

[Bard:] “That’s it.”

[Bard releases the Black Arrow and it flies off at high speed from Bain’s shoulder. It hurtles through the air and sinks all the way to the feathers, almost 6-7 feet, into Smaug’s chest through the spot without a scale. As Smaug leaps forward in pain and fear, Bard grabs Bain, just as Smaug careens into the tower. Bard and Bain fall with the tower into the water as Smaug rolls and slides through the town, destroying everything in the town. He struggles to fly into the sky. With massive effort, he manages to flap a few hundred feet up, screaming and wheezing in pain, then gasps for breath. His eyes lose their light, and he falls back down upon the city, dead, with the end of the arrow sticking out of his heart. He lands directly upon the Master’s boat, crushing it and presumably killing everyone on board.]



[The sound of Smaug hitting the ground echoes throughout the land, all the way to the dwarves on the mountain. They jump up in surprise.]

[Oin:] “What was that? What happened?”

[Bilbo:] “It fell. I saw it.”

[They all peer out at the town in the early morning light.]

[Bilbo:] “It’s dead. Smaug is dead!”

[Thorin, still staring at the Lonely Mountain and not at the town, has a strange expression of happiness cross his face.]

[Gloin:] “By my beard! I think he’s right! Look there! The ravens of Erebor are returning to the mountain!”

[Several birds can be seen cawing and approaching the Lonely Mountain.]

[Oin:] “Aye - Word will spread. Before long every soul in Middle-earth will know - The dragon is dead!”

[As the dwarves laugh in glee, Thorin hurries down from the lookout point and approaches the gates of Erebor.]

[On screen:] THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES



[In Dol Guldur, Gandalf languishes in his cage.]



[Suddenly, Galadriel’s voice sounds in his head, and he looks up with a start.]

[Galadriel:] “You are not alone, Mithrandir…”

[Galadriel:] “... (Ae boe) i le eliathon, im tulithon.” [not translated onscreen: If you should ever need my help, I will come.]” 



[It is early morning. On the banks of the lake are refugees and wreckage from Laketown. People are screaming and crying, and some of the wooden things are on fire. There are dead bodies washed up on the shore. Alfrid comes crawling up out of the water, screaming.]

[Alfrid:] “Will somebody help me? HELP!”

[He clambers over a dead body, only to realize that the person is still alive. Alfrid rolls over him into the water, screaming.]

[Alfrid:] “HELP!”

[Meanwhile, some of the survivors begin helping each other and salvaging whatever supplies they can. Tauriel, Sigrid, and Tilda walk about, looking for Bard.]

[Sigrid:] “DA!”

[Tilda:] “DA!”

[Sigrid:] “DA!”

[Alfrid screams up into the sky.]

[Alfrid:] “WHY ME?”

[There is still screaming and crying all about, as people pull the bodies of their loved ones out of the water and onto the shore. The dwarves, Oin, Bofur, and Fili, grab a boat and begin to push it out into the water. Kili approaches Tauriel.]

[Kili:] “Tauriel.”

[Fili:] “Kili, come on! We’re leaving.”

[Tauriel:] “They are your people - You must go.”

[Tauriel looks at Kili both sadly and guardedly, then walks past him. Kili looks distraught for a second, then whirls around to face her again.]

[Kili:] “Come with me. I know how I feel; I’m not afraid. You make me feel alive.”

[Tauriel turns her head away.]

[Tauriel:] “I can’t.”

[Kili reaches out and grabs her arm, then says something in Dwarvish.]

[Kili:] “Tauriel, amralime” (presumably, “Tauriel, my love”)

[Hearing this, Tauriel looks at Kili, shocked and surprised.]

[Tauriel:] “I don’t know what that means.”

[Kili smiles.]

[Kili:] “I think you do.”

[Tauriel smiles and begins to lean toward Kili, but then suddenly straightens up and makes her face blank.]



[She addresses Legolas, whom she sensed approaching behind her.]

[Tauriel:] “Hîr nín, Legolas.” [Subtitle: My Lord Legolas.]

[Kili looks with hostility over Tauriel’s shoulder at Legolas.] 

[Legolas:] “Maewado i Naug.” [Subtitle: Take your leave of the Dwarf.]

[Legolas:] “Boe i nadh egeno.” [Subtitle: You are needed elsewhere.]

[Tauriel looks at Kili for a few more seconds, then, torn by her duty, begins to turn away. Kili sadly turns toward his friends launching the boat. He suddenly pauses, then turns around and hurries back to Tauriel. He takes her hand and places his black stone into it, folding her fingers closed over it. She gasps and looks at him as he gets close to her face and holds her hands to his heart.]



[Kili:] “Keep it. As a promise.”

[They smile at each other, then Kili runs toward the boat. Legolas looks on, confused. Tauriel looks down at the stone in her hand, then looks after Kili and the dwarves in the boat; her eyes are wet. Kili looks back at her for several moments, then begins rowing.]



[Meanwhile on shore, the woman from earlier who spoke about the prophecy hurries about, handing out blankets to the survivors.]

[Woman:] “These are dry. You need them.”

[Man:] “Thank you.”

[Alfrid pushes between people as he approaches the woman.]

[Alfrid:] “Oi! Give me one of them! I’ll catch my death in this cold!”

[Woman:] “Oh, find your own! You’re not in charge now, Alfrid Blackspell!”

[Alfrid:] “That is where you are wrong - In absence of the Master, the power cedes to his deputy, which in this instance is my good self. Now give me that blanket!”

[He leans forward and grabs the blanket; she pulls back on the other end. They tug over it, yelling at each other.]

[Woman:] “Master’s deputy? Don’t make me laugh.”

[She manages to pull the blanket away and begins hitting Alfrid with it.]

[Woman:] “You’re a sneak-thief, more like. I’ll be dead, before I answer to the likes of you!”

[As she turns away, Alfrid grabs her.]

[Alfrid:] “Maybe that can be arranged!”

[Alfrid raises his hand to strike her, only to have someone else grab his upraised arm. It turns out to be Bard, who leans close to Alfrid.]

[Bard:] “I wouldn’t go turning on your own, Alfrid. Not now!”

[Bard spins Alfrid around, and Alfrid trips and falls over Bain’s outstretched foot. Bain and the Woman smile. Sigrid and Tilda come running out of the crowd.]

[Tilda:] “DA!”

[Bard:] “Come here!”

[Bard grabs up his daughters in a huge hug. He clutches them to himself as the townspeople look on.]

[Bard:] “It’s alright.”

[A man, Percy (who used to check the papers of the boats entering town), steps out of the crowd and exclaims loudly.]

[Percy:] “It was Bard! He killed the dragon! I saw it with my own eyes. He brought the beast down. He shot him dead, with a black arrow.”

[The people begin cheering for Bard and laying their hands on him, exclaiming their thanks.]

[Various Townspeople:] “You saved us all! Thank you.”

[Alfrid suddenly appears and raises Bard’s arm, then cheers loudly for him.]

[Alfrid:] “ALL HAIL - TO THE DRAGONSLAYER! ALL HAIL - KING BARD!”

[The people grow silent, and Bard yanks his hand away from Alfrid’s. Alfrid, still with his hand up in the air, speaks to the crowd.]

[Alfrid:] “I have said it many times - This is a man of noble stock. A born leader!”

[Bard:] “Do not call me that! I’m not the master of this town.”

[Bard looks around.]

[Bard:] “WHERE IS HE? WHERE’S THE MASTER?”

[Woman:] “Halfway down the Anduin, with all our coin, I don’t doubt. You would know!”

[She points at Alfrid, who looks scared.]

[Woman:] “You helped him empty the treasury.”

[Alfrid:] “No - I tried to stop him.”

[Alfrid raises his voice and addresses all the people, scared and pleadingly. The people yell at him angrily, calling him a traitor and a mongrel. Alfrid hides behind Bard, keeping Bard between himself and the Woman.]

[Alfrid:] “I pleaded. I pleaded. I said, ’Master - NO!’”

[As the people continue to yell abuse at him, Alfrid looks terrified.]

[Alfrid:] “Think of the children.”

[Alfrid grabs Tilda and holds her in front of him.]

[Alfrid:] “Will nobody think of the children?!”

[Tilda angrily stomps on Alfrid’s foot, forcing him to let go of her. The people yell for Alfrid’s head.]

[Man:] “To the tree with you!”

[Several men grab Alfrid and raise him up, preparing to hang him with a rope. He screams with fear. Bard steps in and stops the people.]

[Bard:] “Enough! Let him go! Let him go!”

[The people quiet down and let Alfrid fall to the ground. Bard turns about, addressing them all.]

[Bard:] “Look around you! Have you not had your fill of death?”

[Alfrid pops up.]

[Alfrid:] “Aye.”

[Bard pushes him back down.]

[Bard:] “Winter is upon us; we must look to our own, to the sick and the helpless. Those who can stand, tend to the wounded. And those who have strength left - follow me. We must salvage what we can.”

[Bard turns and begins to stride through the crowd.]

[Woman:] “What then? What do we do then?”

[Bard:] “We find shelter.”

[The townspeople begin to follow him as he walks away.]



[Fili, Kili, Bofur, and Oin climb up the Lonely Mountain. As they approach the gates, they stop in shock and fear as they see the destruction caused by Smaug as he smashed through the front gate to fly out of the mountain. They look at each other, then run into the halls of Erebor. Bofur calls out, his voice echoing in the silence.]

[Bofur:] “Hello! Bombur? Bifur? Anybody?”

[They clamber through the halls, looking for their kin. As they run down a staircase, Bilbo runs up toward them from another part of the city, calling out.]

[Bilbo:] “WAIT! WAIT!”

[Oin:] “It’s Bilbo! He’s alive!”

[Bilbo:] “Stop! Stop! Stop!”

[They meet each other in a corridor.]

[Bilbo:] “You need to leave. We all need to leave.”

[Bofur:] “We only just got here?!”

[Bilbo:] “I have tried talking to him, but he won’t listen.”

[Oin:] “What do you mean, laddie?”

[Bilbo:] “[Thorin:]. Thorin. Thorin. He’s been out there for days. He doesn’t sleep. He barely eats. He’s not been himself - not at all. It’s this - It’s this place. I think a sickness lies on it.”

[As Bilbo speaks, Fili looks past him and sees something that causes him to wrinkle his face in consternation.]

[Kili:] “Sickness? What kind of sickness?”

[Fili walks past the group and starts heading further down into Erebor, looking at something. Bilbo and the others run after him, trying to stop him.

[Bilbo:] “Fili. Fili. Fili!”

[As they continue heading down, a golden light begins to be visible on the walls. They round a corner, and stop short at the sight of Smaug’s treasure, heaped so high over the floor of the cavern that the ground is barely visible. As they stare, they see Thorin, dressed in ornate robes and covered in jewelry, stride slowly out of a doorway. Thorin begins speaking softly, apparently to himself. He looks strange, almost possessed, and the dwarves look at him in surprise.]

[Thorin:] “Gold - Gold beyond measure. Beyond sorrow and grief.”

[Thorin looks up and sees the others standing there.]



[Thorin:] “Behold - the great treasure hoard of Thror.”

[He suddenly flings something high into the air to where the dwarves are standing on a stairwell landing, and Fili catches it. It is a giant bloodred jewel.]

[Thorin:] “Welcome, my sister’s sons, to the kingdom of EREBOR.”



[The newly-come dwarves enter the room where the other dwarves are, and they greet each other warmly with massive hugs.]

[Bofur:] “Balin!”

[Nori:] “Kili!”

[Bofur:] “Bombur!”



[All the dwarves comb through the piles of treasure, searching for the Arkenstone.]

[Thorin:] “Any sign of it?!”

[Dwalin:] “Nothing yet.”

[Nori:] “Nothing here.”

[Thorin:] “Keep searching!”

[Oin:] “That jewel could be anywhere!”

[Thorin:] “The Arkenstone is in these halls - find it!”

[Dwalin:] “You heard him - Keep looking!”

[Thorin:] “All of you - No one rests until it is found!” 

[Bilbo, hearing all this, looks awkward.]


[Bilbo walks out onto the ramparts of the front gates, near the hole Smaug made in the wall. He paces back and forth for a while. Then, after looking around to see that no one is watching, he sits down. He thinks back to his encounter with Smaug, when he is standing near the Arkenstone and Smaug is speaking to him.]

FLASHBACK - START

[Smaug:] “I am almost tempted to let you take it, if only to see Oakenshield suffer, watch it destroy him, watch it corrupt his heart and drive him mad.”

[Samgu growls and extends his neck to eat Bilbo, but Bilbo puts on his ring and slips away. Unseen by Smaug, Bilbo grabs the Arkenstone and hides it in his tunic. Smaug angrily begins breathing fire.]

FLASHBACK - END

[Once more checking than no one is watching, he reaches into his tunic and pulls out the Arkenstone. He stares at it, as it glows with patterns of light from within.]



[At the Laketown camp, the people are packing supplies and getting ready to leave.]

[Bard:] “Take only what you need. We have a long march ahead.”

[Legolas:] “Where will you go?”

[Bard looks across the lake.]

[Bard:] “Where is only one place.”

[Alfrid:] “The mountain! You are a genius, sire. We can take refuge inside the mountain. It might smell a bit of dragon - The women can clean up. It will be safe and warm and dry, and full of stores, bedding, clothing...the odd bit of gold.”

[Bard:] “What gold is in that mountain is cursed. We will take only what was promised to us - only what we need to rebuild our lives.”

[Bard dumps a bundle of sticks he was packing into Alfrid’s hands and walks off. Alfrid then dumps the sticks into the hands of an old woman who already has a load of sticks.]

[Alfrid:] “Here - pull your weight!“

[Legolas:] “News of the death of Smaug will have spread through the lands.”

[Bard:] “Aye.”



[Legolas:] “Other will now look to the mountain - for its wealth, or its position.”

[Bard:] “What is it you know?”

[Legolas:] “Nothing for certain. It’s what I fear may come.”

[Legolas, looking concerned, looks off into the distance.]



[Azog is riding his white warg at the head of a vast company of Orcs, all armed for battle. They are crossing a rocky plain, with the Lonely Mountain in the distance as their destination. Bolg, riding his Warg, charges in from Laketown to deliver his message to Azog.]

[Bolg:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Woodland Elves!]

[Bolg:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: The King’s son and a She-elf - They tracked us down to Laketown.]

[Azog raises his arm, the hand of which Thorin cut off but is now replaced with a large blade, and the legions of Orcs stop.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: And you killed them?]

[Bolg:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: They fled squealing like cowards]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: You fool! They will return with an Army of Elves at their backs!]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Ride to Gundabad.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Let the Legions come forth.]

[Bolg grunts in assent and rides off. Azog turns and faces his Orcs, raising his bladed arm.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Elves! Men! Dwarves! The Mountain will be their tomb!]

[He turns and begins riding toward the Mountain.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: To war!]



[Tauriel and Legolas stride through the Laketown camp.]

[Tauriel:] “You saw something out there.”

[Legolas:] “The orc I pursued out of Laketown - I know who he is. Bolg - a spawn of Azog the Defiler. A warg pack was waiting for him on the outskirts of Esgaroth. They fled into the north. These orcs were different from the others. They wore a mark I had not seen for a long time. The mark of Gundabad.”

[Tauriel stops in shock and turns to Legolas.]

[Tauriel:] “Gundabad?”

[Legolas:] “An orc-stronghold in the far north of the Misty Mountains.”

[An elf from Mirkwood rides up on a horse and addresses Legolas.]

[Elf:] “Hîr nín, Legolas. Celin ’winiath o adar lín.” [Subtitle: My Lord Legolas, I bring word from your Father.]

[Elf:] “Cân i hi danwenidh na le.” [Subtitle: You are to return to him immediately.] 

[Legolas:] “Tolo, Tauriel.” [Subtitle: Come, Tauriel.]

[Elf:] “Hîr nín. Edlennen Tauriel.” [Subtitle: My Lord, Tauriel is banished.]

[Legolas:] “Edlennen?” [Subtitle: Banished?]

[Both Legolas and Tauriel are surprised.]

[Legolas:] “You may tell my father: If there is no place for Tauriel, there is no place for me”



[Tauriel:] “Legolas. It is your King’s command”

[Legolas:] “Naw aran nín, mal ú-gân innas nín.” [Subtitle: Yes, he is my King. But he does not command my heart.]

[Legolas turns and walks away from the elven messenger.]

[Legolas:] “I ride north. Will you come with me?”

[Tauriel:] “To where?”

[Legolas:] “To Gundabad.”

[Tauriel and Legolas ride out of the Laketown camp on Legolas’s horse. The townspeople, carrying their possessions and stretchers with their sick and injured, begin the long trek around the lake and toward the Mountain.]



[In Dol Guldur, Gandalf begins chanting something while hanging in the cage. Meanwhile, Radagast is chanting in his home.]

[Gandalf:] “_ _ _”

[Radagast:] “_ _ _”

[Gandalf:] “_ _ _”

[An Orc approaches Gandalf, his sword bared.]
 
[Orc:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Spells will not save you, old man.]

[Meanwhile, Galadriel walks through the ruins of Dol Guldur, barefoot, her ring shining with a white light in the darkness.] 

[The orc throws Gandalf, still in his cage, around, while Gandalf cries out in pain.]

[Galadriel approaches Gandalf’s location, his cries of pain sounding loudly in the night as the Orc abuses him.]

[The Orc pulls open the cage and lifts Gandalf up with one arm.]

[Orc:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: This is my Master’s domain.]

[He throws Gandalf forcefully down onto the floor.]

[Orc:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Die now Wizard!]

[Galadriel appears, and the Orc sees her.]



[The Orc roars, then runs at Galadriel. Galadriel lifts her arm, and a shockwave of power and energy expands all around her, lighting up the sky for miles around, as loose rubble flies around from the massive pressure.]

[With the Orc dead, Galadriel picks up Gandalf, who is almost dead, and walks through the ruins carrying him.]

[Sauron’s voice speaks out of the darkness, and Galadriel stops.]

[Sauron:] “Shre nazg golugranu kilmi-nudu” [Subtitle: Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky.]

[Sauron:] “Ombi kuzddurbagu gundum-ishi” [Subtitle: Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone.]

[Galadriel:] “Nine for mortal men doomed to die.”

[Galadriel looks around in shock as the nine Nazgul slowly become visible around her, in corporeal yet partially translucent forms. As they slowly draw closer, wielding their weapons, Galadriel stumbles back until she is sitting on the pedestal of a statue in a courtyard, with Gandalf in her lap. Still unconscious, Gandalf groans.]

[Sauron:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: You cannot fight the shadow. Even now you fade. One light alone in the darkness.]

[Gandalf looks up with a determined face.]



[Galadriel:] “I am not alone.”

[Behind the Nazgul, Elrond and Saruman stride out of the ruins, Elrond wielding his sword and Saruman his staff.]



[Saruman:] “Are you in need of assistance, my Lady?”

[Snarling, the Nazgul leap forward to confront them.]

[Elrond:] “You should have stayed dead.”

[Elrond and Saruman leap forward, attacking the Nazgul. The Nazgul disappear every time they are hit, yet they keep coming back. Saruman throws a Nazgul off a cliff, but it manages to clamber back up the cliff and resumes attacking. Despite this, Saruman and Elrond are still fighting incredibly well.]

[Galadriel talks to Gandalf.]

[Galadriel:] “Mithrandir, come back.”



[As Saruman and Elrond fight in the background, Galadriel leans down and kisses Gandalf’s head. He suddenly breathes in deeply and wakes up, gasping for breath.]

[Gandalf:] “He is here.”

[Galadriel:] “Yes - the darkness has returned.”

[As the others continue fighting, Radagast appears in the courtyard on his rabbit-pulled sled.]



[Radagast:] “[Gandalf:]! Gandalf, climb on!”

[As Gandalf tries to get on the sled, Galadriel lays on the floor, weakened from bringing Gandalf back from the brink of death. She tries to help him up, but she is too weak.]

[Galadriel:] “He is weak. He cannot remain here - It is draining his life.”

[Gandalf manages to get on the sled, and Radagast prepares to leave.]

[Galadriel:] “Go! Quickly!”

[Gandalf reaches back and grabs Galadriel’s arm. He speaks to her, his voice still hoarse and weak.]

[Gandalf:] “Come with me, my Lady.”

[Galadriel looks at him sadly, then pulls her arm away with an effort. Her skin becomes white and her eyes and body shine with a strange, powerful, and dark light. She turns to face the Nazgul.]

[Galadriel:] “NO!”

[As Radagast and Gandalf ride off, Galadriel lays on the floor, surrounded by fighting Nazgul and Elrond and Saruman. Eventually, Elrond and Saruman manage to kill all the Nazgul, and they pause for breath. As they approach Galadriel to see if she’s alright, the wind picks up, then a nearby tower explodes in a massive ball of fire. In its place is the flaming eye of Sauron. Saruman and Elrond flinch in the face of its power.]

[Sauron:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: It has begun.]

[Sauron:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: The East will fall. So shall the Kingdom of Angmar rise.]

[The pupil of the Eye expands to reveal Saruon’s old form. Beside him rise the Nazgul, all of whom he has resurrected.]

[Sauron:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: The time of the Elves is over. The Age of the Orc has come.]

[As the Nazgul raise their weapons and approach, Elrond and Saruman prepare to fight, only to step back as Galadriel rises. Galadriel is glowing with a green light, and her entire appearance has changed to one of power. She raises her hand, in which is a bright light coming from the Phial of Galadriel, and the Nazgul are blasted away, back into the Eye.]

[Galadriel:] “YOU HAVE NO POWER HERE, SERVANT OF MORGOTH!”

[The fire around the Eye disappears, leaving only Sauron’s armored form. Sauron is chanting as well. He begins flashing in the fire of his Eye.]

[Galadriel:] “YOU ARE NAMELESS, FACELESS, FORMLESS!”

[As she speaks, her voice changes into a deep, booming, and powerful tone. The Eye keeps flashing with fire and chanting in Black Speech, while Elrond and Saruman raise their hands to shield themselves from the battle of power between Galadriel and Sauron.]

[Galadriel:] “GO BACK TO THE VOID FROM WHENCE YOU CAME!”

[The force of her power extinguishes the Eye’s flames and sends Sauron hurtling into the sky. Galadriel’s powerful form disappears, and she staggers; Elrond catches her as she collapses. Sauron can be seen hurtling toward the horizon, presumably to land in Mordor. Gandalf and Radagast stop and look; Gandalf, holding his sword, is looking better.]

[Elrond:] “Dandollen hon.” [Subtitle: We were deceived.]

[Galadriel:] “The spirit of Sauron endured.”

[Saruman:] “And has been banished.”

[Galadriel:] “He will flee into the east.”

[Elrond:] “Gondor should be warned. The must set a watch on the walls of Mordor.”

[Saruman:] “No. Look after the Lady Galadriel. She has spent much of her power. Her strength is failing. Take her to Lothlórien.”

[Elrond:] “My Lord Saruman, he must be hunted down and destroyed, once and for all.”

[Saruman:] “Without the Ring of Power, Sauron can never again hold dominion over Middle-earth. Go now! Leave Sauron to me.”

[Saurman turns to face the direction in which Sauron was hurled, with a strange expression in his eyes.]



[Gandalf and Radagast arrive at Rhosgobel.

[Gandalf:] “I need a horse!”

[Radagast:] “What? Gandalf, where are you going?”

[Gandalf:] “To warn Erebor. They have no idea what is coming. I saw them with my own eyes - rank upon rank of Moria-orcs. You must summon our friends, bird and beast - the battle for the mountain is about to begin.”



[In Erebor, Thorin gazes upon the throne, over which the Arkenstone had been inlaid before it was lost. He speaks to Balin, Dwalin, and Bilbo, who are behind him.]

[Thorin:] “It is here in these halls - I know it.”

[Dwalin:] “We have searched and searched…”

[Thorin:] “Not well enough!”

[Dwalin:] “Thorin, we all would see the stone returned.”

[Thorin:] “And yet, it is still not FOUND!”

[Balin:] “Do you doubt the loyalty of anyone here?”

[Thorin turns and slowly walks toward Balin and Dwalin.]

[Balin:] “The Arkenstone is the birthright of our people.”

[Thorin:] “It is the King’s Jewel.”

[He begins shouting.]

[Thorin:] “AM I NOT THE KING?!”

[As Thorin turns away, Balin, Dwalin, and Bilbo look uneasy.]

[Thorin:] “Know this - If anyone should find it and withhold it from me, I will be avenged.”

[As Thorin walks away, Bilbo looks very disgruntled.]



[Balin is in a quiet corner somewhere, breathing deeply as if he had just been weeping. Bilbo finds him.]

[Balin:] “Dragon-sickness - I’ve seen it before. That look. That terrible need. It is a fierce and jealous love, Bilbo. It sent his grandfather mad.”

[Bilbo:] “Balin, if-if Thorin...had the Arkenstone...”

[Bilbo slightly cocks his head, and Balin looks surprised, understanding Bilbo’s implication.]

[Bilbo:] “...if it was found - Would it help?”

[Balin:] “That stone crowns all. It is the summit of this great wealth, bestowing power upon he who bears it. Will it stay his madness? No, lad; I fear it would make it worse. Perhaps it is best that it remains lost.” 

[Balin raises his eyebrows at Bilbo.]



[Bilbo is sitting on a bench in a hall. He reaches into his coat pocket and pulls something out. Thorin, walking in an adjoining hallway, sees the action.]

[Thorin:] “What is that?!”

[Thorin strides rapidly toward Bilbo, and Bilbo rises.]

[Thorin:] “In your hand!”

[Bilbo:] “It-It’s nothing.”

[Thorin:] “Show me.”

[Bilbo:] “It…”

[Bilbo holds out his hand, and in it is an acorn.]

[Bilbo:] “I picked it up in Beorn’s garden.”

[Thorin:] “You’ve carried it all this way.”

[Bilbo:] “I’m gonna plant it in my garden, in Bag End.”

[His anger fading, Thorin smiles fondly at Bilbo.]

[Thorin:] “That’s a poor price to take back to the Shire.”

[Bilbo:] “One day it’ill grow. And everytime I look at it, I’ll remember - Remember everything that happened, the good, the bad. And how lucky I am that I made it home.”

[They smile at each other. Bilbo prepares to speak.]

[Bilbo:] “Thorin, I...”

[Suddenly, Dwalin comes up and interrupts.]

[Dwalin:] “Thorin, survivors...from Laketown. They are streaming into Dale. There’s hundreds of them.”

[Thorin’s smile fades into a stern, uncompromising face.]

[Thorin:] “Call everyone to the gate.”

[Thorin strides off, shouting.]

[Thorin:] “TO THE GATE! NOW!”



[The Laketowners walk into the ruins of Dale. They stare around at the ruins, including many charred and burned bodies.

[Bard:] “Come on, keep moving.”

[Alfrid:] “SIRE! Sire! Up here” 

[Bard looks up to see Alfrid on one of the city walls. Bard joins him.]

[Alfrid:] “Look sire, the braziers are lit.”

[They see giant braziers full of fire at the gates of Erebor.]

[Bard:] “So, the company of Thorin Oakenshield survived.”

[Alfrid:] “Survived? You mean there’s a bunch of dwarves in there with all that gold?”

[Bard:] “You shouldn’t worry, Alfrid. There’s gold enough in that mountain for all.”

[Bard walks away and calls to the people.]

[Bard:] “Make camp here tonight. Find what shelter you can. Get some fires going. Alfrid, you take the night watch.”



[As Alfrid looks sourly at Bard and stomps off, Bard looks back at the Mountain, uneasy.]



[Within the walls of Erebor, the dwarves work to block up the entrance that Smaug broke through. They carry rocks both by hand and with the help of various pulleys and other machines.] 

[Thorin:] “I want this fortress made safe by sunup. This mountain was hard won - I will not see it taken again.”

[Kili:] “The people of Laketown have nothing. They came to us in need. They have lost everything.”

[Thorin:] “Do not tell me what they have lost. I know well enough their hardship. Those who have lived through dragonfire should rejoice. They have much to be grateful for.”

[Thorin looks out at the city of Dale, where many fires can be seen lit by the people. He then turns and shouts to his dwarves.]

[Thorin:] “More stone! BRING MORE STONE TO THE GATE!”

[Bilbo looks on in despair.]



[Gandalf rides his horse rapidly through a plain.



[It is night in Dale, and the people sit around, as the healthy tend to the wounded. Infants can be heard crying.]

[Man:] “These children are starving! We need food!”

[Man:] “We won’t last three days!”

[Percy:] “Bard, we don’t have enough.” 

[Bard:] “Do want you can, Percy”

[Woman:] “We need more water.”

[Bard:] “The children, the wounded and the women come first.”

[Bard walks over to where Alfrid had been standing guard. Alfrid was actually napping, and he wakes up as Bard speaks.]

[Bard:] “Morning, Alfrid. What news from the night watch?”

[Alfrid:] “All quiet, sire, I must report. Nothing gets past me.”

[Yawning, he gets up and follow Bard outside, only to find that Bard has stopped suddenly in the archway.]

[Bard:] “Except an army of elves, it would seem.”

[Outside, the courtyard is packed full of Mirkwood elves dressed in full battle gear, standing in perfectly ordered lines. The people of Laketown begin coming out of their buildings and see the elves.]



[Bard walks down the steps and approaches the elves, some lines of which turn and step back to make a pathway for Bard.]



[As he exits out the bank of elves, King Thranduil rides up on his steed, and all the elves turn to face him.]

[Bard:] “My lord Thranduil; we did not look to see you here.”

[Thranduil:] “I heard you needed aid.”

[Thranduil turns and looks at a wagon that is pulling up; it is loaded with food and drink for the people. The people of Laketown smile and cheer, and begin unloading the cart with the elves’ help. Bard approaches Thranduil gratefully.]

[Bard:] “You have saved us! I do not how to thank you.”

[Thranduil:] “Your gratitude is misplaced. I did not come on your behalf.”

[Thranduil’s voice is cold.]

[Thranduil:] “I came to reclaim something of mine.”

[Meanwhile, in the Mountain, Thorin picks up a beautiful necklace made of tiny, shining, and white gems. We hear Thranduil speaking in a flashback from the previous movie.]

[DIALOG-FLASHBACK - START]

[Thranduil:] “There are gems in the mountain that I too desire. White gems of pure starlight.

[DIALOG-FLASHBACK - END]

[Thorin:] “The white gems of Lasgalen.”

[Thorin:] “I know an Elf-Lord who would pay a pretty price for these.”

[Thorin tosses the necklace back into the pile of jewels, scattering many of the tiny gems.]

[Meanwhile, back in Dale, Thranduil watches his troops march out of Dale. Bard runs up to him.]



[Bard:] “Wait! Please, wait! You would go to war over a handful of gems?”

[Thranduil:] “The heirlooms of my people are not lightly forsaken.”

[Bard:] “We are allies in this. My people also have a claim upon the riches in that mountain! Let me speak with Thorin!”

[Thranduil:] “You would try to reason with a dwarf?”

[Bard:] “To avoid war? Yes!”



[In Erebor, Thorin strides toward the blocked off gate, calling th other dwarves to him.]

[Thorin:] “Come on!”

[The dwarves lay down their tools, pick up their weapons, and follow him up the stairs they’ve created in the blockage, all the way to a platform they have built at the top of the gate from which they have a vantage point over the plain in front of the gate. They see the walls of Dale filled with Elves ready for war. Bard rides up the path to the gate on a horse, and stops in front of the gate.]

[Bard:] “Hail Thorin, son of Thrain! We are glad to find you alive beyond hope.”

[Thorin:] “Why do come to the gates of the king under the mountain armed for war?”

[Bard:] “Why does the king under the mountain fence himself in? Like a robber in his hole.”

[Thorin:] “Perhaps it is because I am expecting to be robbed.”

[Bard:] “My lord - We have not come to rob you, but to seek fair settlement. Will you not speak with me?”

[Thorin nods, and steps away from the platform and down the stairs. Bard dismounts his horse and crosses the bridge in front of the gate. As he approaches the blockade, a raven flies out of the opening above the gate and wings away rapidly, cawing loudly. Bard sees a hole built into the blockade, and Thorin strides up to the other end of the hole.]

[Thorin:] “I’m listening.”

[Bard:] “On behalf of the people of Laketown, I ask that you honor your pledge. A share of the treasure so that they might rebuild their lives.”

[Thorin:] “I will not treat with any man while an armed host lies before my door.”

[Bard:] “That armed host will attack this mountain, if we do not come to terms.”

[Thorin:] “Your threats do not sway me.”

[Bard:] “What of your conscience? Does it not tell you our cause is just?! My people offered you help. And in return you brought upon them only ruin and death!”

[Thorin:] “When did the men of Laketown come to our aid, but for the promise of rich reward?!”

[Bard:] “A bargain was struck!”

[Thorin:] “A bargain? What choice did we have but to barter our birthright for blankets and food? To ransom our future in exchange for our freedom? You call that a fair trade? Tell me, Bard the Dragonslayer…”

[Bard looks up, surprised.]

[Thorin:] “...Why should I honor such terms?”

[Bard:] “Because you gave us your word. Does that mean nothing?”

[Thorin turns away from the hole, disappearing from Bard’s view. He leans back against the blockade and for a moment looks tired and weary.]



[He then looks at the other dwarves and Bilbo, who are all standing there. He shouts back to Bard.]



[Thorin:] “Be gone, ere arrow fly!”

[Bard slaps the rock angrily, then mounts his horse and rides back to Dale. The company watches him go from the top of the platform.]

[Bilbo:] “What are you doing?! You cannot go to war.”

[Thorin:] “This does not concern you.”

[Bilbo:] “Excuse me?! But just in case you haven’t noticed, there is an army of elves out there. And not to mention several hundred angry fishermen. We-We are in fact outnumbered.”

[Thorin turns to look at Bilbo, smiling.]

[Thorin:] “Not for much longer.”

[Bilbo:] “What does that mean?”

[Thorin:] “It means Master Baggins, you should never underestimate dwarves.”

[Thorin turns to the whole group.]

[Thorin:] “We have reclaimed Erebor - Now we defend it!”

[As Thorin strides down the steps, Bilbo and Balin looks distressed.]



[Bard rides back to the gates of Dale, where Thranduil is waiting.]

[Bard:] “He will give us nothing.”

[Thranduil:] “Such a pity. Still, you tried.”

[Bard:] “I do not understand - Why? Why would he risk war?”

[They look back toward the Mountain in time to see the dwarves dislodge the head of one of the massive stone statues, causing it to fall and break the raised bridge to the gate, thus disabling any attackers from approaching the gates.]

[Thranduil:] “It is fruitless to reason with them; they understand only one thing.”

[Thranduil pulls out his sword and gazes at it.]

[Thranduil:] “We attack at dawn! Are you with us?”

[As Thranduil rides back toward the city, Bard looks over his shoulder at Erebor.]



[In Dale, Bard and the Lakepeople begin collecting and distributing the various weapons and armor stored there. In Erebor, the dwarves do the same, suiting up for battle. As Bilbo walks by, Thorin calls out to him, holding something.]

[Thorin:] “Master Baggins, come here!”

[Bilbo comes up and sees that Thorin is holding a tunic of white mail.]

[Thorin:] “You are going to need this. Put it on.”

[Bilbo begins removing his jacket.]

[Thorin:] “This vest is made of silver steel - “Mithril” it was called by my forebears.”

[Thorin holds it up so that Bilbo can slide into it.]

[Thorin:] “No blade can pierce it.”

[Bilbo finishes putting it on, then looks at himself; the other dwarves watch too.]

[Bilbo:] “I look absurd. I’m not a warrior; I’m a Hobbit.”



[Thorin:] “It is a gift. A token of our friendship. True friends are hard to come by.”

[Although he had started off smiling at Bilbo, he looks toward the other dwarves and frowns, then grabs Bilbo by the shoulder and pulls him away where the other dwarves can’t hear him.]

[Thorin:] “I have been blind. Now I begin to see. I am betrayed!”

[Bilbo:] “Betrayed?”

[Thorin:] “The Arkenstone.”

[As Thorin moves closer to him, Bilbo looks extremely uncomfortable and worried. Thorin whispers to Bilbo.]

[Thorin:] “One of them has taken it.”

[Bilbo almost sighs audibly in relief.]

[Thorin:] “One of them is false.”

[Bilbo:] “Thorin...the quest is fulfilled. You’ve won the mountain. Is that not enough?”



[Thorin:] “Betrayed by my own kin.”

[Bilbo:] “No eh...You...You made a promise...to the people of Laketown. Is-Is this treasure truly worth more than your honor? Our honor, Thorin. I was also there, I gave my word.”

[Thorin:] “For that I’m grateful. It was nobly done. But the treasure in this mountain does not belong to the people of Laketown! This gold...is ours...and ours alone. By my life I will not part with a single coin! Not...one...piece of it!”

[As Thorin speaks, his voice grows deeper and more and more like Smaug’s, until the very last line, which was exactly a repeat of what Smaug had said previously to Bilbo. Thorin is clearly mentally affected, and Bilbo stares at him in shock as the other dwarves, dressed for battle, stride by.]



[Legolas and Tauriel leave their horses and scramble up a rocky outcrop. They crouch behind some rocks at the top and see a fortress ahead.]

[Tauriel:] “Gundabad. What lies beyond?”

[Legolas:] “An old enemy - The ancient kingdom of Angmar. This fortress was once its stronghold. It is where they kept their great armories, forged their weapons of war.”

[A light flickers in a window of the fortress, then disappears.]

[Tauriel:] “A light! I saw movement.”

[Legolas:] “We wait for the cover of night. It is a fell place, Tauriel. In another age our people waged war on those lands.”

[Legolas pauses, looking pained. Tauriel looks at him.]

[Legolas:] “My mother died there. My father does not speak of it. There is no grave, no memory, nothing.”



[In Dale, the people are preparing for war, sharpening swords and collecting supplies. They jump out of the way as Gandalf gallops into town on his horse.]

[Gandalf:] “Let me through!”

[Gandalf:] “Make way!”

[Gandalf dismounts in the main courtyard and looks surprised to see men drilling with swords and companies of elves marching by. Alfrid comes up to him, upset.]

[Alfrid:] “No, No, NO! Oi! You - pointy hat!”

[Gandalf turns to look at him.]

[Alfrid:] “Yes, you. We don’t want no tramps, beggars nor vagabonds around here. We got enough trouble without the likes of you. Off you go! On your horse.”

[Gandalf:] “Who’s in charge here?!”

[Bard walks up.]

[Bard:] “Who is asking?”



[A little bit later, Gandalf is meeting with Bard and Thranduil in a tent.]

[Gandalf:] “You must set aside your petty grievances with the dwarves. War is coming! The cesspits of Dol Guldur have been emptied. You’re ALL in mortal danger!”

[Bard:] “What are you talking about?”

[Thranduil:] “I can see you know nothing of wizards. They are like winter thunder on a wild wind rolling in from a distance, breaking hard in alarm. But sometimes a storm is just a storm.”

[Gandalf:] “Not this time. Armies of orcs are on the move. And these are fighters! They have been bred for war. Our enemy has summoned his full strength.”

[Thranduil:] “Why show his hand now?”

[Gandalf:] “Because we forced him! We forced him when the company of Thorin Oakenshield set out to reclaim their homeland. The dwarves were never meant to reach Erebor; Azog the Defiler was sent to kill them. His master seeks control of the mountain. Not just for the treasure within, but for where it lies, its strategic position.”

[As Gandalf talks, they have left the tent and walked outside to a spot from where they can clearly see the gates of Erebor.]



[Gandalf:] “This is the gateway to reclaiming the lands of Angmar in the north. If that fell kingdom should rise again, Rivendell, Lothlorien, the Shire, even Gondor itself will fall!”

[Thranduil:] “These orc armies you speak of, Mithrandir - Where are they?”

[Gandalf is unable to answer.]



[Meanwhile, an Orc rides out of a tunnel on a Warg and approaches Azog, who is feeding his Warg at the entrance to the tunnel.]

[Orc:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Our army will be in position by dawn. The attack will be sudden and swift!]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: The fools! They have forgotten what lives beneath these lands.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: They have forgotten the great Earth-eaters.]

[As they ride away, we see the side of a hill covered in giant holes, each the entrance to a tunnel. A sound of the earth being drilled and crushed can be heard all around. The tunnels are pointing toward the Lonely Mountain in the distance.]



[Back at Gundobad, it is dark.]

[Tauriel:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: If we are going in - we should move now.]

[Suddenly, massive bats being screeching and flying around.]

[Tauriel:] “Dúilith secherig.” [Subtitle: They are swarming.]

[Legolas:] “These bats are bred for one purpose.”

[Tauriel:] “For what?”

[Legolas:] “For war.”

[As the bats swarm overhead, a figure rides out on a Warg. It is Bolg, dressed for battle. He raises his mace and shouts out a command; trumpets sound, and gates in the bottom of the fortress open, releasing rank upong rank of massive orcs, each with a giant spear at least three times longer than the orcs’ height.]

[Bolg:] “_ _ _”

[The massive company begins marching away, with the bats following and wheeling overhead.]

[Tauriel:] “Din methithar i phain.” [Subtitle: We must warn the others.]

[Legolas:] “Penim lû. Tolo!” [Subtitle: We may be too late - hurry!]

[Bolg:] “_ _ _”

[As Bolg yells out a command, the ranks of Orcs part to let smaller, lighter, and faster Orcs run ahead of their companions, snarling.]



[Back in Thranduil’s tent, Gandalf confronts Thranduil.]

[Gandalf:] “Since when has my council counted for so little? What do you think I’m trying to do?!”



[Thranduil:] “I think you’re trying to save your dwarvish friends. And I admire your loyalty to them, but it does not dissuade me from my course. You started this, Mithrandir. You will forgive me if I finish it.”

[Thranduil exits the tent and calls to one of the elves.]

[Thranduil:] “Are the archers in position?”

[Elf:] “Yes my Lord.”

[Thranduil:] “Give the order. If anything moves on that mountain - kill it!”

[Thranduil:] “The dwarves are out of time.”



[It is night; at the blocked off entrance to the gate, a rope is suddenly thrown over the edge. Bilbo clambers hand-over-hand down the rope, slipping along the way. He manages to climb across the moat using some of the rubble. He begins running toward Dale.]



[Gandalf approaches Bard.]

[Gandalf:] “You, Bowman! Do you agree with this? Is gold so important to you? Would you buy it with the blood of dwarves?!”

[As the speak, Bilbo sneaks past some of the Laketown guards.]

[Bard:] “It will not come to that. This is a fight they cannot win.”

[Suddenly, Bilbo appears and addresses both of them.]

[Bilbo:] “That won’t stop them. You think the dwarves will surrender - They won’t. They will fight to the death to defend their own.”

[Gandalf:] “Bilbo Baggins!”

[Bilbo smiles happily.]



[Back in Thranduil’s tent, Bilbo is presented before Thranduil.]

[Thranduil:] “If I’m not mistaken, this is the halfling who stole the keys to my dungeons from under the nose of my guards.”

[Bilbo looks extremely uncomfortable.]

[Bilbo:] “Yes. Sorry about that.”

[There is a silence for a while, then Bilbo steps forward and puts a wrapped package on the table.]

[Bilbo:] “I came...to give you this.”

[He unwraps the package to reveal the Arkenstone. Thranduil rises in surprise.]

[Thranduil:] “The heart of the mountain! The King’s Jewel.”

[Gandalf and Bard approach to look at it in awe.]

[Bard:] “And worth a king’s ransom. How is this yours to give?”

[Bilbo:] “I took it as my fourteenth share of the treasure.”

[Gandalf smiles slightly.]

[Bard:] “Why would you do this? You owe us no loyalty.”

[Bilbo:] “I’m not doing it for you. I know that dwarves can be obstinate and pigheaded and difficult, suspicious and secretive…with the worst manners you can possibly imagine, but they also brave and kind...and loyal to a fault. I’ve grown very fond of them, and I would save them if I can.”

[Bilbo:] “Thorin values this stone above all else. In exchange for its return, I believe he will give you what you are owed. There will be no need for war!”

[Gandalf, Bard, and Thranduil look at each other.]



[Gandalf leads through Dale.]

[Gandalf:] “Rest up tonight. You must leave on tomorrow.”

[Bilbo:] “What?”

[Gandalf:] “Get as far away from here as possible.”

[Bilbo:] “I’m-I’m not leaving. You picked me as the fourteenth man. I’m not about to leave the company now.”

[Gandalf:] “There is no company - not any more. And I don’t like to think what Thorin will do when he finds out what you’ve done.”

[Bilbo:] “I’m not afraid of Thorin.”

[Gandalf:] “But you should be! Don’t underestimate the evil of gold. Gold over which a serpent has long brooded. Dragon-sickness seeps into the hearts of all who come near this mountain.”

[Gandalf looks at Bilbo appraisingly.]

[Gandalf:] “Almost all.”

[Gandalf sees Alfrid walking by and calls out to him.]

[Gandalf:] “You there! Find this Hobbit a bed, and fill his belly with hot food. He has earned it.”

[Alfrid grudgingly comes over and begins to lead Bilbo away. As they go, Gandalf grabs Alfrid’s arm and whispers to him.]

[Gandalf:] “Hey. Keep an eye on him. If he should try to leave, you will tell me.”

[Alfrid walks off, cursing as a group of people walk in front of him and he pushes his way between them.]

[Alfrid:] “Move it! Stupid...”



[Early the next morning, we see that the plain in front of the Mountain is covered in legions of Elves and men, armed for battle. The dwarves, also prepared, watch from above the gate blockade.]





[Alfrid comes to wake Bilbo up, carrying a bowl of food.]

[Alfrid:] “Wakey, Wakey, Hobbit. Up you...get.”

[He pauses as he realizes that Bilbo is not in the room where he had left him.]



[Thranduil and Bard ride together to the front of the armies and approach their side of the broken bridge over the moat. From above the blockade, Thorin draws a bow and shoots an arrow at the ground directly in front of Thranduil and Bard, who immediately halt in surprise.]

[Thorin:] “I will put the next one between your eyes!”

[Thorin draws his bow again, and the dwarves on the wall cheer and shake their weapons. Thranduil stares at Thorin angrily, then slightly tilts his head. Instantly, several rows of Elves near the front of the army pull out their bows, nock their arrows, and aim at the dwarves, all in one fluid motion. The dwarves’ cheering cuts off abruptly as all of them but Thorin duck behind the ramparts. After holding the pose for a few seconds, Thranduil raises his hand, and the elves easily put away their arrows. Thorin still has his bow drawn, though.]

[Thranduil:] “We’ve come to tell you: payment of your debt has been offered...and accepted.” 

[Thorin:] “What payment? I gave you nothing! You have nothing!”

[Bard:] “We have this.”

[Bard reaches into his robe and pulls out the Arkenstone, holding it above his head. Thorin, shocked, lowers his bow.]



[Kili:] “They have the Arkenstone? Thieves! How came you by the heirloom of our house? That stone belongs to the king!”

[Bard:] “And the king may have it - in our good will.”

[Bard puts the Arkenstone back into his robe.]

[Bard:] “But first he must honor his word.”

[Thorin whispers to himself, and the dwarves near him can hear.]

[Thorin:] “They are taking us for fools. This is a ruse, a filthy lie.”

[Balin looks shocked that Thorin’s mental state has deteriorated to the point at which he would even consider this. Thorin then yells out.]

[Thorin:] “THE ARKENSTONE IS IN THIS MOUNTAIN! IT IS A TRICK!”

[At the top of the ramparts, Bilbo steps out from the dwarves.]

[Bilbo:] “It-It’s no trick. The stone is real. I gave it to them.”

[As Bilbo speaks, Thorin’s expression changes to a mixture of sorrow and anger. Thranduil and Bard look worries, as they thought Bilbo was still safely in Dale. Thorin and the other dwarves look at Bilbo in shock.]

[Thorin:] “You…”

[Bilbo:] “I took it as my fourteenth share.”

[Thorin:] “You would steall from me?”

[Bilbo:] “Steal from you? No. No. I may be a burglar, but I like to think I’m an honest one. I’m willing to let it stand against my claim.”

[Thorin:] “Against your claim?! Your claim! You have no claim over me you miserable rat!”

[Thorin throws down his bow in anger and begins walking toward Bilbo.]

[Bilbo:] “I was going to give it to you. Many times I wanted to, but...”

[Thorin:] “But what, thief?!”

[Bilbo:] “You are changed, Thorin! The dwarf I met in Bag End would never have gone back on his word! Would never have doubted the loyalty of his kin!”

[Thorin:] “Do not speak to me...of loyalty!”

[Thorin shouts to the other dwarves.]

[Thorin:] “Throw him from the rampart!”

[Bilbo looks shocked. The other dwarves, rather than obeying Thorin, step away from Bilbo in confusion. Thranduil and Bard look concerned. Thorin is surprised that no one obeyed him.]

[Thorin:] “DO YOU HEAR ME?!”

[Thorin grabs Fili’s arm, but Fili shakes him away.]

[Thorin:] “I will do it myself!”

[He lunges forward and grabs Bilbo, shouting.]

[Thorin:] “CURSE YOU!”

[Fili:] “No!”

[As Thorin struggles with Bilbo, the other dwarves leap forward, shouting, to pull Thorin away. Thorin manages to grab Bilbo and begins pushing him over the rampart.]

[Thorin:] “Cursed be the Wizard that forced you on this Company!”

[Suddenly, Gandalf appears, striding through the armies. His voice is magically amplified to incredibly loud, deep, and powerful tones.]

[Gandalf:] “IF YOU DON’T LIKE MY BURGLAR…”

[His voice returns to a normal volume and tone.]



[Gandalf:] “Then please don’t damage him. Return him to me! You’re not making a very splendid figure as king under the mountain, are you? Thorin son of Thrain!”

[Thorin slowly lets Bilbo up, and some of the other dwarves rush to help Bilbo up.]

[Thorin:] “Never again will I have dealings with wizards...”

[Bofur gently pushes Bilbo toward the rope he’d hung the night before to climb down the walls.]

[Bofur:] “Go.”

[Thorin:] “Or Shire-rats!”

[Bilbo throws his coiled rope over the wall and clambers down.]

[Bard:] “Are we resolved? The return of the Arkenstone for what was promised.”

[Thorin, breathing heavily, looks to a ridge in the distance, as if looking for someone or something.]

[Bard:] “Give us your answer! Will you have peace or war?”

[As Thorin bows his head, a large raven flies up to the ramparts and perches beside him. Thorin and the raven stare at each other.]

[Thorin:] “I will have war!”

[A rumbling is heard in the distance, and the armies look up to see the ridge being covered by troops of heavily armored dwarves, lead by a huge dwarf riding a battle-pig.]

[Gandalf:] “Ironfoot.”

[The Erebor dwarves begin cheering and screaming as they see their backup arriving.]

[Thranduil:] “Ribo i thangail!” [not translated onscreen: Rush the shield-fence!]

[Thranduil rides through his army as his Elves and the Lakepeople turn away from the gates of Erebor and begin marching quickly toward the oncoming Iron Hills dwarves. Gandalf strides along with them, Bilbo rushing to keep up.]

[Bilbo:] “Who is that? He doesn’t look very happy.”

[Gandalf:] “It is Dain, lord of the Iron Hills - Thorin’s cousin.”

[Bilbo:] “Are they alike?”

[Gandalf:] “I always found Thorin the more reasonable of the two.”

[The two armies halt a short distance from one another, and Dain rides his pig onto a rocky overlook to address the Elves and Men.]

[Dain:] “Good morning! How are we all? I have a wee proposition, if you wouldn’t mind giving me a few moments of your time. Would you consider...just sodding off!”

[The townspeople, clutching their weapons, step back in fear, while the Elves pull out their swords and step forward.]

[Dain:] “All of you - right now!”

[Bard:] “Stand fest!”

[Gandalf strides forward.]

[Gandalf:] “Come now, lord Dain!”

[Dain:] “Gandalf the Grey. Tell this rabble to leave, or I’ll water the ground with their blood!”

[Gandalf:] “There is no need for war between dwarves, men and elves! A legion of orcs march on the mountain. Stand your army down!”



[Dain:] “I will not stand down before any elf! Not least this faithless woodland sprite!”

[He gestures toward Thranduil, who looks angry.]

[Dain:] “He wishes nothing but ill upon my people! If he chooses to stand between me and my kin - I’ll split his pretty head open! See if he’s still smirking then!”

[Thranduil smiles furiously, and the Erebor dwarves cheer.]

[Thranduil:] “He’s clearly mad, like his cousin!”

[Dain:] “You hear that, lads?!”

[He turns and rejoins his army.]

[Dain:] “Come on! Let’s give these ***** a good hammering!”

[Iron Hills Dwarf:] “_ _ _”

[A dwarf yells out a command, and the Iron Hills dwarves raise their weapons and cheer. The Elves perform a complicated maneuver to put their shield-and-spear bearers at the front of the army, while the arches stand behind them. As both armies prepare to fight, a rumbling is heard at the base of a spur of the mountain. The armies grow silent as they turn to look. Gandalf whispers to himself.]

[Gandalf:] “Were-worms!”

[At the spur of the mountain where the rumbling is coming from, massive worms, hundreds of feet long and dozens of feet thick, break through the rocks. Their mouths are essentially giant drilling machines, strong enough to crush the toughest rocks in their jaws. The human, Elf, and dwarf armies look on in shock.]

[Dain:] “Oh, come on!”

[The worms suddenly retreat into the tunnels they’d made through the mountains approaching the Lonely Mountain. As the mist clears, we see Azog and a few other Orcs standing atop a hill. Behind them are several massive contraptions made of wood, rope, and cloth, meant as signalling devices. 

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Come forth my Armies!]

[As Azog gives a sign, one of the wooden structures opens up in a particular position, and a horn sounds. Immediately, legions of Orcs begin pouring out of the were-worm tunnels.]

[Dain:] “The hordes of hell are upon us! To battle! To battle, sons of Durin!”

[Dain and part of his army turn and rush toward the oncoming Orcs.]

[Fili:] “I’m going over the wall! Who’s coming with me?”

[The other dwarves cheer and agree, preparing to climb down.]

[Thorin:] “Stand down!”

[Dwarf:] “What?”

[Fili:] “Are we to do nothing?”

[Thorin:] “I said STAND DOWN!”

[As Thorin walks away, the other look on in shock and surprise. Meanwhile, as Dain and a company of his dwarves rush toward the oncoming Orcs, the Elves stay right where they are. The dwarves are clearly outnumbered by the Orcs.]

[Bilbo:] “The elves, will they not fight?”

[Gandalf:] “Thranduil! This is madness!”

[Thranduil looks back at the Iron Hills dwarves, who have stopped and built a shield wall with their massive spears pointed outward, lead by the chants of the leader. The orcs are fast approaching the shield wall. Suddenly, right as the Orcs reach the dwarves, the Elves leap up over the shield wall from behind, wielding their swords, and begin raining down blows on the Orcs. As the Elves press forward, the dwarvish shield wall is raised and the dwarves rush forward, cutting down Orcs with their spears. Dain rides furiously through the Orcs, smashing them left and right with his hammer.]

[As the remaining elves march toward the battle, Gandalf and Bilbo are standing in one place.]

[Bilbo:] “Eh, Gandalf - Is this a good place to stand?”

[At the top of the hill, Azog commands his Orcs.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Send in the War Beasts!]

[The wooden signalling devices change their position to show a new signal. Gandalf, seeing the signal, looks toward the tunnels to see new legions of Orcs, including massive trolls and other monsters, come out. Thranduil shouts to his troops.]

[Thranduil:] “_ _ _” 

[The Elves stop and pull out their bows.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: They cannot fight on two fronts. Now we make our move.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Attack the city!]

[As a horn sound and the signalling device changes again, another legion of Orcs that had been waiting for the signal turn and march toward Dale, which is between the current battle and the tunnels.]

[Gandalf:] “Azog - he’s trying to cut us off”

[They see massive trolls, each large enough to carry multiple other dwarves and wooden structures such as catapults on their back, march toward the city along with the armies of Orcs.]

[Bard:] “All of you, fall back to Dale! Now!”

[Bard, the Lakepeople, Gandalf, and Bilbo rush toward the city, trying to intercept the Orcs.]

[Gandalf:] “To the city! Bilbo! This way!”

[The monstrous trolls approaching the city stop at a rise overlooking Dale. They bend over and plant all four legs on the ground, thus making their backs horizontal. On their backs are catapults loaded with large rocks; orcs on the trolls’ backs wind up the gears of the catapults. At a signal from their leader orc, who strikes the ground with his mace, the catapults are released, and the rocks fly toward Dale. They smash into the walls and towers, destroying everything they hit. As Bard, at the front of his army, rides across a bridge into Dale, we see the Orc army approaching the wall from another area. A troll with a giant triangle-shaped rock strapped to his head runs up to the wall and smashes into it headfirst, knocking it down and knocking himself out in the some motion. The orcs behind him rush into the city through the hole, entering the houses and killing whatever people they find.] 



[In the city, the screaming townspeople flee from the oncoming orcs. Sigrid and Tilda hide in a building as they see a troll climb over the wall. Meanwhile, Bain, holding a sword, looks for them among the fleeing people.]

[Bain:] “Sigrid! Tilda!”



[Bard rides into the city and dismounts, drawing his sword. He runs against the flow of the fleeing people, looking for his children.]

[Bard:] “My children! Where are my children?”

[Woman:] “I saw them. They were down in the old market.”

[Bard:] “The market?! Where are they now? Tilda! Sigrid!”

[Percy runs up at the head of a company of the Laketown soldiers.]

[Percy:] “Bard, Orcs are storming over the causeway!”

[Bard:] “Get the bowmen to the eastern parapet. Hold them off for as long as you can!”

[Percy:] “Archers, this way!”

[Fleeing Man:] “The orcs have taken Stone Street! The market’s overrun!”

[Bard:] “The rest of you, follow me!”

[Bard’s group encounters the orcs, and they begin fighting. Elsewhere in Dale, Gandalf and Bilbo are also fighting the orcs. A group of townspeople run toward the orcs, and Alfrid is running with them.]

[Alfrid:] “Charge! Onward! To the death!”

[While still shouting, he stops running, panting for breath. Seeing that no one is watching him, he hides in a building.]

[Orcs are chasing Sigrid and Tilda. As they run screaming around a corner, Bain jumps out and kills the lead orc. The second orcs knocks him to the ground and swings at him, only to get his sword caught on something overhead. Bain uses this chance to thrust his sword into the orc, killing it. He and his sisters round a corner and see their father fighting further up the lane, uphill from them.]

[Sigrid:] “DA!”

[Tilda:] “Da! We’re down here!”

[Bain:] “Here!”

[Bard hears them and turns to see them, looking relieved. However, his expressions changes to shock when he sees a troll enter the lane behind the children, throwing men many feet away with a single blow of his mace. The troll sees the children and growls, and the girls scream. They are too far away for Bard to reach them in time, and he looks around frantically. As the troll approaches the children, Bard tilts upright a cart that had been laying sideways in the courtyard. He scrambles into it and launches it down the avenue toward the children. The troll raises its mace to smash the children, but pauses in surprise when it sees Bard hurtling toward it in the cart.]

[Bard:] “BAIN, SIGRID - GET DOWN!”

[They throw themselves to the floor as the cart bounces over them. It then smashes into the troll and sends it flying; Bard is also thrown forward, and he manages to thrust his sword into the troll’s heart in a flying strike.]



[We see an overhead shot of both battlefields: the plains in front of Erebor, and the battle in Dale. Bard and his children run up an empty street.]

[Bard:] “Listen - I need you to gather the women and children. Take them to the Great Hall and barricade the door.”

[Alfrid, hiding in a doorway nearby, hears them speaking. Bard gently takes Bain’s sword from him.]

[Bard:] “You understand - you must not come out for any reason!”

[Tilda:] “We wanna stay with you!”

[Alfrid steps out.]

[Alfrid:] “Show your father some respect!”

[Alfrid:] “You leave it to me, sire. You heard him, we make to the Great Hall!”

[Alfrid grabs Tilda and Sigrid and begins rushing them away. Bard calls after him.]

[Bard:] “Alfrid, women and children only. I need every man fighting. See that you return!”

[He thrusts the sword into Alfrid’s hands.]

[Alfrid:] “I’ll get them to safety, sire.”

[Seeing orcs appear nearby, he nervously hurries away.]

[Alfrid:] “And my sword is yours to command.”

[He begins rounding up the people he sees.]

[Alfrid:] “Get up!”

[Bard holds Bain’s face earnestly.]

[Bard:] “Look after them!”

[Alfrid:] “Shift it, granny!”

[As Bain catches up to Alfrid, Alfrid rudely tosses him the sword, and Bain looks at him in disgust.]

[Bard and his men continue fighting orcs.]

[Bain and the other help the weak and elderly.]

[Bain:] “Make for the Great Hall!”

[As they approach the Great Hall, Alfrid runs and pushes his way through the people, knocking many of them over in his haste to reach the doors.]

[Alfrid:] “Out of my way! Abandon the cripples!”



[As more and more orcs and trolls enter the city, Thranduil rides his elk into the city by crossing one of the bridges. As he crosses, his elk tramples many orcs. The elk lowers its horns and spears five orcs at the same time, lifting them up so that Thranduil can behead all of them with one swing of his sword. As they thunder into the city, the elk is killed by multiple Orc arrows to the chest. As it falls, Thranduil leaps clear and rolls. He comes up from his roll to find himself surrounded by orcs. He pulls out both his sword and begins fighting them, soon reinforced by his elven foot troops.]

[In the city, the men, elves, and orc all fight each other, and the orcs seems to have the upper hand because of their massive numbers. Azog watches from his hilltop vantage point.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: They cannot hold the city. The Dwarves are almost spent.]

[In the plains in front of Erebor, the Iron Hills dwarves are being driven back by the orcs. Orcs manage to kill Dain’s war pig.]

[Dain:] “You buggars!”

[He begins killing orcs left and right with his hammer and by headbutting them.]

[Dain:] “Where’s Thorin?! We need him! Where is he?”

[From his vantage point, Azog gloats as both battlefronts are being won by the orcs.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Let these lands run with blood! Slaughter them all.]

[Bard:] “FALL BACK!”



[Meanwhile, in Erebor, Thorin is merely sitting on the throne. Dwalin approaches him.]

[Dwalin:] “Since when do we forsake our own people? Thorin, they are dying out there.”

[Thorin:] “There are halls beneath halls within this mountain - places we can fortify.”

[Dwalin looks disappointed and angry.]

[Thorin:] “Shore up, make safe. Yes…”

[Thorin:] “...Yes - that is it. We must move the gold further underground - to safety!”

[Thorin begins walking away, but Dwalin angrily calls out to him.]

[Dwalin:] “Did you not hear me?! Dain is surrounded! They’re being slaughtered, Thorin.”

[Thorin:] “Many die in war. Life is cheap. But a treasure such as this cannot be counted in lives lost. It is worth all the blood we can spend!”

[Dwalin:] “You sit here in these vast halls, with a crown upon your head, and yet you are lesser now than you have ever been.”

[Thorin:] “Do not speak to me as if I was some lowly dwarf lord…”

[As he speaks, Thorin is clearly mentally affected.]

[Thorin:] “As-As if I were still...Thorin...Oakenshield.”

[Thorin:] “I AM YOUR KING!”

[Thorin roars and pulls out his sword; however, he is so unbalanced that he almost falls over.]

[Dwalin:] “You were always my king. You used to know that once.”

[Dwalin bows his head in sorrow.]

[Dwalin:] “You cannot see that you have become.”

[Thorin:] “Go! Get out...before I kill you.”

[After looking at each other for a while, Dwalin turns and leaves.]



[Thorin walks through the hall in which he tried to drown Smaug; the entire floor is covered in gold a few feet deep. In his head, he hears many of the words that he spoke or were spoken to him earlier.]

DIALOG-FLASHBACK - START

[Dwalin:] “You sit here...with a crown upon your head...you are lesser now than you have ever been...”

[Thorin:] “...but a treasure such as this cannot be counted in lives lost...”

[Balin:] “...a sickness lies upon that treasure...”

[Bard:] “...the blind ambition of a mountain-king…”

[Thorin:] “...AM I NOT THE KING...”

[Thorin:] “...this gold...is ours...and ours alone...” 

[Balin:] “...treasure…”

[Thorin:] “...I will not part with a single coin...”

[Bard:] “...he could not see beyond his own desire...”

[Thorin:] “...Oakenshield...”

[Thorin:] “...Oakenshield...”

[Dwalin:] “...this is Thorin, son of Thrain, son of Thror...”

[Thorin:] “...I am not my grandfather…my grandfather.”

[Gandalf:] “...you are the heir to the throne of Durin...”

[Dwalin:] “...they are dying out there.”

[Gandalf:] “...take back...take Erebor...”

[Dwalin:] “...Dain is surrounded... surrounded...is surrounded...Dain is surrounded...”

[Gandalf:] “...take back your homeland…”

[Bilbo:] “...you are changed, Thorin...”

[Thorin:] “...I am not my grandfather…”

[Bilbo:] “...is this treasure truly worth more than your honor...”

[Thorin:] “...I am not my grandfather…”

[The voices suddenly stop, and Thorin looks down and sees the shadowy shape of Smaug sliding beneath the gold {he is imagining things}.]

[Gandalf:] “...this treasure will be your death…”

DIALOG-FLASHBACK - END

[Thorin screams as the gold beneath him turns into a sinkhole and he begins drowning, surrounded by gold. He screams as he tries to escape, but keeps getting pulled down. As he disappears beneath the gold, his imagination/dream ends. He is standing in the golden court. He yanks off his crown and throws it to the floor. He has finally comes back to his senses.]



[Meanwhile, the battle is going badly.]

[Dain:] “FALL BACK! FALL BACK! TO THE BARRICADE! FALL BACK!”

[The remaining dwarves begins retreating toward the gates of Erebor, with the orcs in pursuit.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Now comes their end. Prepare for the final assault.]

[A signal horn sounds, the the orcs regroup to march on the dwarves.]



[Just inside the gates of Erebor, the dwarves of the Company sit desolately, hearing the cries of battle outside but unable to help their kin. They rise as they see Thorin approaching from further in the mountain, sword drawn.]



[He is no longer dressed in his royal robes and arbor, but in a simple leather outfit. Kili rises and begins shouting.]

[Kili:] “I will not hide behind a wall of stone, while others fight our battles for us!”

[Thorin and Kili continue to approach each other.]

[Kili:] “It is not in my blood, Thorin.”

[They stop in front of each other.]

[Thorin:] “No, it is not. We are sons of Durin. And Durin’s folk do not flee from a fight.”

[Thorin lays his hand on Kili’s shoulder, smiling. Kili smiles back at him through his tears.]



[They touch foreheads. Thorin turns to the rest of the dwarves.]

[Thorin:] “I have no right to ask this of any of you; but will you follow me one last time?”

[The dwarves rise and raise their weapons, ready to follow their leader and friend again.]



[Dain and his surviving dwarves set up a desparate shield wall in front of the moat by Erebor’s gates; the orcs line up by rank, ready to attack them. Azog suddenly stops the orcs with him on the hill from signalling the attack.]
 
[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Not yet! Wait...wait]

[Several heavily armored trolls shoulder their way to the front of the Orc ranks.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Attack...now!]

[The orcs sound their signalling horn, and the orcs and trolls begin to march forward. Suddenly, another trumpet is heard; it is Bombur, atop the wall. The orcs stop in confusion. In Dale, Bilbo and Gandalf hear the sound too and look up in surprise.]

[Bilbo:] “Thorin!”

[The barricade of rocks in the gateway of Erebor suddenly smashes outward as it is hit from inside by a giant golden statue that the dwarves had hung up like a bell. The rocks fall forward and make a rough bridge across the moat. Thorin and his dwarves rush out and through the ranks of the Iron Hills dwarves; Azog looks on in shock. Dain begins shouting to his troops.]

[Dain:] “TO THE KING! TO THE KING!”

[Thorin:] “Du Bekâr!” [not translated onscreen: To arms!]”

[Thorin leads the way as all the dwarves form a wedge behind him. They smash their way through the orc ranks, releasing their pent up anger and hatred.]

[In Dale, Bilbo and Gandalf look out at the plain from an abandoned causeway.]

[Bilbo:] “The dwarves! They’re rallying!”

[They watch as the dwarves, fighting with new vigour, destroy the orcs.

[Gandalf:] “They are rallying to their king!”



[Bard speaks to his remaining men.]

[Bard:] “Any men who want to give their last - follow me!”

[They charge through the city and clash with the orcs, fighting with reckless abandon now that they know the dwarves are back at it.]



[In the Great Hall, The Woman grabs a spear and speaks to the others huddled inside.]

[The Woman:] “I say we stand with our men in life and in death! Arm yourselves!”

[Many of the women and older men grab their weapons and follow her; Bain grabs his sword. Meanwhile, a woman speaks to an old lady sitting hunched over under her shawl.]

[Woman #2:] “Come with us, love.”

[Alfrid:] “No, no, no! You leave an old woman be.”

[Woman #2:] “Don’t be afraid.”

[The “woman” under the shawl suddenly stops using the fake voice and speaks in a male voice; it is actually Alfrid, who was trying to disguise himself as an old lady.”

[Alfrid:] “I said get off!”

[The Woman reaches over the yanks off the shawl, revealing Alfrid to everyone.]

[The Woman:] “Alfrid Lickspill, you are a coward!”

[Alfrid:] “Coward?! Not every man is brave enough to wear a corsett!”

[Woman #1:] “You’re not a man, you’re a weasel!”

[As the others grab whatever tools or weapons they can find to join the battle, an urn falls over, and Alfrid sees it fall. It breaks open to reveal that is was full of gold and silver coins.]



[On the battlefield, Thorin defeats an orc. He calls out to Dain, who is not far away.]

[Thorin:] “Dain!”

[Dain:] “Thorin!”

[Dain:] “Hold on! I’m coming!”

[They continue killing orcs, all the while getting closer to each other.]

[Dain:] “Hey cousin, what took you so long?!”

[In a brief respite, they are able to meet and hug.]

[Dain:] “There’s too many of these buggars, Thorin. I hope you’ve got a plan.”

[Thorin looks up and sees the hilltop on which Azog’s wooden machines and signalling orders.]

[Thorin:] “Aye - We’re going to take out their leader!”

[Dain:] “Azog...”

[Thorin strides forward and mounts a large goat that Dain’s army had brought.]

[Thorin:] “I’m gonna kill that piece of filth!”

[Thorin, Dwalin, Fili, and Kili, each on a goat, charge toward Azog’s hill, smashing through the Orc armies in their way.]

[Dwalin:] “Lead on!”



[Back in Dale, Gandalf watches human spearmen and archers kill a massive troll.]

[Gandalf:] “We may yet survive this.”

[Bilbo:] “[Gandalf:]!”

[Gandalf kills an orc, then hurries over to where Bilbo is standing at the wall and watching Thorin, Dwalin, Fili, and Kili ride up a spur of the mountain to where Azog is.]

[Bilbo:] “It’s Thorin!”

[Gandalf:] “And Fili, Kili...and Dwalin. He’s taking his best warriors!”
 
[Bilbo:] “To do what?”

[Gandalf:] “To cut the head off the snake.”

[Atop the hill, Azog hears the sound of goat hooves, and he snarls. Thorin and Co. reach some ruins on top of the hill, killing orcs along the way; there is a frozen river between them and where Azog is. ]



[Legolas and Tauriel arrive back in Dale together on a horse; they charge through the streets, killing orcs on their way. They come to where Gandalf is standing.]

[Legolas:] “Gandalf!”

[Gandalf:] “Legolas... Legolas Greenleaf!”

[Legolas:] “There is a second army! Bolg leads a force of Gundabad orcs. They are almost upon us!”

[Gandalf:] “Gundabad…This was their plan all along. Azog engages our forces, then Bolg seeps in from the north.”

[Bilbo:] “Wha...the north...where is the north, exactly?!”

[Gandalf:] “Ravenhill.”

[Gandalf turns and strides over to the parapets to look at the hill where Thorin went; that is Ravenhill.]

[Bilbo:] “Ravenhill…Thorin is up there! And Fili and Kili - they’re all up there!”

[At the sound of Kili’s name, Tauriel is alarmed. Together, they all look out toward the top of Ravenhill, which is shrouded in mist.]



[Thorin and Co. are still fighting in the ruins across the frozen river from Azog’s stronghold. Having defeated all the enemies at present, they look out across the river at the ruins in which Azog was last seen; his wooden signalling machines are visible through the mist.]

[Thorin:] “Where is he?”



[Kili:] “Looks empty. I think Azog has fled!”



[Thorin:] “I don’t think so...Fili, take your brother. Scout out the towers. Keep low and out of sight. If you see something; report back, do not engage - do you understand?!”

[Dwalin:] “We have company; Goblin mercenaries. No more than a hundred.”

[They look back the way they came to see goblins running over the ruins toward them.]

[Thorin:] “We’ll take care of them. Go! Go!”

[Dwalin:] “Come on!”

[As Fili and Kili run towards the river, Thorin and Dwalin prepare to meet the goblins rushing toward them.]



[In a moment of peace, Thranduil walks slowly through the city, seeing the fallen bodies on the ground, many of which are his own elves. His commander comes running up.]

[Thranduil:] “Recall your company.”

[The commander blows a horn. Gandalf comes running up.]

[Gandalf:] “My lord, dispatch this force to Ravenhill! The dwarves are about to be overrun. Thorin must be warned.”



[Thranduil:] “By all means, warn him. I have spent enough Elvish blood in defense of this accursed land - No more!”

[Thranduil walks away haughtily and angrily.]

[Gandalf:] “Thranduil?!”

[Bilbo:] “I’ll go!”

[Gandalf:] “Don’t be ridiculous! You’ll never make it!”

[Bilbo:] “Why not?”

[Gandalf:] “Cause they will see you coming and kill you!”

[Bilbo:] “No, they won’t.”

[Gandalf looks at Bilbo peculiarly.]

[Bilbo:] “They won’t see me.”

[Gandalf:] “It’s out of the question - I won’t allow it!”

[Bilbo:] “I’m not asking you to allow it, Gandalf.”

[Gandalf says nothing; they nod to each other, then Bilbo strides away. Turning a corner, he presses into an alcove and pulls out his ring. He looks at it for a few moments, then puts it on.]



[Invisibly, he runs through the city, seeing the remaining battles. In his ring-enhanced vision, the elves appear to be beings of white light, while the orcs are like solid shadows.]



[As Thranduil and his elves march through the city, killing orcs, they stop abruptly as they see Tauriel standing in the middle of the lane ahead of them, looking resolute.]

[Tauriel:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: You will go no further.]

[Tauriel:] “ You will not turn away - not this time!”

[Thranduil:] “Get out of my way!”

[Tauriel:] “The dwarves will be slaughtered!”

[Thranduil:] “Yes, they will die. Today, tomorrow, one year hence, a hundred years from now - what does it matter? They are mortal.”



[Thranduil has slowly been approaching Tauriel as he speaks. Suddenly, Tauriel whips out her bow and nocks an arrow, pointing it at Thranduil.]

[Tauriel:] “You think your life is worth more than theirs, while there is no love in it? There is no love in you!”

[Thranduil looks at her angrily for a moment; suddenly, he whips out his sword and slices Tauriel’s bow in half. As she drops it in shock, Thranduil lifts the point of his sword to her neck and speaks angrily.]

[Thranduil:] “What do you know of love?! Nothing! What you feel for that dwarf is not real! You think it is love?! Are you ready to die for it?”

[Suddenly, another sword, Orcrist, is laid atop Thranduil’s. It is Legolas. He pushes Thranduil’s sword away.]

[Legolas:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: If you harm her, you will have to kill me.]

[As Thranduil stares at him in shock and anger, Thranduil turns to Tauriel.]

[Legolas:] “I will go with you.”

[They hurry away together.]



[Alfrid, still wearing a woman’s outfit and clutching the gold he found to his chest, weaves through the city, dodging orcs. As he backs toward a wall, an orc climbs over it and roars at him. It raises its club to kill him, and he screams. Suddenly, from behind him, Bard shoots and arrow and kills the orc. Alfrid falls over, and money falls out of his dress, and he tries to gather it up]

[Bard:] “Get up!”

[Alfrid:] “Get away from me! I don’t take orders from you! People trusted you. They listened to you. The master’s mantle was there for the taking. And you threw it all away - for what?”



[Bard turns and looks back. Alfrid follows his gaze to see Bard’s children in a doorway, staring at him as his dress is full of coins. He turns and stomps away.]

[Bard:] “Alfrid - your slip is showing.”

[Alfrid adjusts his dress, then rushes away.]



[Invisibly, Bilbo is hurrying across bridges toward Ravenhill.]

[Fili and Kili creep quietly through the ruins below Azog’s signalling station. They hear a noise.]
 
[Fili:] “Stay here. Search the lower levels. I’ve got this.”



[Having defeated the goblins, Thorin looks anxiously out over the frozen river.]

[Dwalin:] “Where is that orc filth?”

[Bilbo appears out of thin air behind him, panting.]

[Bilbo:] “Thorin…”

[Thorin:] “Bilbo!”

[Bilbo:] “You have to leave here! Now! Azog has another army attacking from the north. This watchtower will be completely surrounded. There’ll be no way out.”

[Dwalin:] “We are so close! That orc scum is in there. I say we push on.”

[Thorin:] “No! That’s what he wants. He wants to draw us in.”

[Suddenly, Thorin appears to have understood something alarming.]

[Thorin:] “This is a trap!”



[In the ruins, Fili hears a sound in front of him and turns around, only to see lights coming up the hallway from behind him too; he is trapped.]



[Thorin talks to Dwalin.]

[Thorin:] “Find Fili and Kili! Call them back!”

[Dwalin:] “Thorin, are you sure about this?”

[Thorin:] “Do it. We live to fight another day.”

[As they turn to leave, they hear a drum sound from Ravenhill. Looking back at the tower, they see a light appear. Atop the tower, Azog appears, dragging a bloodied Fili behind him.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: This one dies first.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Then the brother.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Then you, Oakenshield.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: You will die last.]

[Fili:] “No! RUN!”

[Thorin, Dwalin, and Bilbo look on in shock as Azog lifts Fili by the neck, then stabs him through the chest with his arm-blade.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Here ends your filthy bloodline!]

[Azog drops Fili, who falls to the ground from the tower, lifeless. He falls past Kili, who has been watching from a doorway below. Kili, seeing his dead brother on the ground, furiously rushes up the tower steps toward Azog.]

[Thorin:] “[Kili:]!”

[Thorin begins running across the frozen river.]

[Dwalin:] “Thorin!”

[Dwalin:] “Thorin...No.”

[Kili rushes up the steps, killing orcs in his way. As Thorin begins to clamber up the ruins, Azog rushes out of a tunnel and attacks him.]



[They fight on the snowy mountainside, Thorin with his sword and Azog with his arm-blade and a mace.]

[Bilbo, still on the other side of the river, hears a noise and ducks as werebats fly out of the fog. His sword glows blue, and he looks back to see Bolg and his forces climbing over the ruins. Seeing Bilbo, the orcs charge at him. Just before they reach him, Dwalin charges up and begins fighting the orcs singlehandedly.]

[Bolg:] “_ _ _” 

[Bolg:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Slay them all!]

[Tauriel and Legolas pause on their way to Ravenhill as they see the Werebats massing.]

[Tauriel:] “No…”

[The werebats fly down to the main battlefields, swooping through ranks of soldiers and causing mayhem. Legolas leaps and grabs the leg of a passing Werebat, and it carries him away. Tauriel sees Kili fighting several orcs on the ruins.]

[Tauriel:] “Kili...”

[Azog and Thorin continue fighting. Thorin manages to knock Azog down, and Azog slides down a slippery slope; before Thorin can chase after him, other orcs arrive and he is forced to fight them. In the courtyard, Bilbo throws rocks at orcs as Dwalin fights. Kili continue fighting his way up the ruins. Tauriel, looking for him, encounters and kills several orcs. Meanwhile, the werebat is still carrying Legolas in the air.]

[As Bilbo continues throwing rocks, Bolg suddenly runs out and smacks Bilbo in the head with the handle of his mace, knocking him out cold. As the werebat carries Legolas over a stone tower, he shoots it through the neck, killing it and forcing it to release him; he drops gracefully on top of the tower. Azog, recovered suddenly charges at Thorin and knocks him onto the surface of the frozen river.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Go in for the kill!]

[Azog yells to his orcs, many of which run out on to the ice to attack Thorin.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Finish him!]

[Thorin looks around rapidly as many orcs run toward him; suddenly, the orcs begin falling over with arrows stuck in them. Legolas is shooting the orcs attacking Thorin from the top of the tower. Thorin, with his broken sword, takes on the remaining orcs.]

[Tauriel, in a moment of peace after dispatching her opponent, calls out.]

[Tauriel:] “[Kili:]!”

[Kili hears her, but he’s too busy fighting two orcs at once to respond.] 

[Tauriel:] “[Kili:]!”

[Kili:] “TAURIEL!”

[Tauriel:] “Kili…”

[Suddenly, Bolg jumps out of a tunnel and kicks Tauriel into a rock.]

[Tauriel:] “NO!”

[Seeing this, Kili angrily defeats his opponents and begins making his way toward her. Tauriel manages to slip out from Bolg’s grasp and begins attacking him with her knife; he manages to grab both her arms and twists them, causing her to shriek in pain; he then smashes his fist down on her head, felling her. Thorin continues fighting orcs while Legolas helps. Kili rushes desperately as he hears Tauriel’s groans. Bolg raises Tauriel up by the throat; she manages to kick him in the knee, causing him to fall. He grabs her and throws her bodily against a wall. As she lays stunned on the ground, he raises his mace for the kill; suddenly, Kili leaps from a parapet onto him. They fight, and Kili manages to slash him, but Bolg grabs Kili by the head and raises the pointed base of his mace to stab him through the chest. Tauriel shout and jumps on Bolg from behind.]

[Tauriel:] “No!”

[Bolg manages to throw her down again, and she can do nothing as Bolg raises his mace and plunges it through Kili’s chest.]

[Tauriel:] “No!”

[As Kili dies, he and Tauriel stare into each others eyes; both of them are tearing up. Bolg drops Kili to the ground dead. Tauriel’s grief turns to anger, and she leaps onto Bolg as he approaches her. They are standing over the edge of a precipice, and Bolg tries to swing her out over the fall. She manages to hold on to him and kick off a stone, launching them both over the edge.]

[Legolas, on top of the tower, suddenly feels the tower shaking. He looks down to see a troll smashing away at the tower’s base. Hearing Tauriel’s grunts, he looks out and sees her rolling with Bolg down the mountainside. She lands on a broken staircase, gasping in pain. Meanwhile, Bolg has landed near her; he rises and prepares to kill her. Legolas, seeing this, reaches back for an arrow, only to find that he has run out. He angrily throws down his bow and pulls out Orcrist. He leaps off the top of the tower and plummets down holding his sword out; he manages to stab the troll in the head, and it hobbles around in pain. Twisting the sword, he manages to get the troll to charge forward, smashing head first into the already-weakened base of the tower. Bolg looks up to see the tower fall over and make a bridge over the chasm in between Legolas and Bolg. As Tauriel lays unconscious, Bolg and Legolas charge at each other over the makeshift bridge. They begin fighting. As they fight, Bolg swings his heavy mace at Legolas and misses, hitting the floor and causing it to crumble and fall into the chasm.]

[Meanwhile, Thorin manages to stab an orc in the knee; another orc rushes up and smashes into him, causing him to slide across the ice all the way to the edge of the waterfall, directly over Legolas and Bolg. Bolg knocks Legolas over, but as he raises his mace, Thorin manages to knock an orc over the edge of the waterfall; it lands on the bridge behind Bolg, breaking through the stones and causing him to fall under a pile of rubble. Another orc approaches Thorin, who is lying on his back, partially hanging over the edge of the waterfall, defenseless. As it raises its sword, Legolas manages to throw Orcrist into the orc’s chest, killing it. As it falls over the edge, Thorin manages to reach out and grab the sword, saving it from going over.]

[As Legolas is watching Thorin, Bolg leaps out of the rubble and swings at Legolas, but Legolas dodges and pulls out his two knives, fighting Bolg with them. Thorin stands and looks in wonder at his blade come back to him; he looks up and sees Azog, alone, facing him. Thorin and Azog approach each other slowly; suddenly, a horn blows, and Azog smiles as a hill in the distance behind him becomes covered with approaching orc help. Azog charges forward and swings a large rock attached to a chain at Thorin, who ducks under it. As Azog is unbalanced by the swing, Thorin manages to get behind him and slash him. Azog angrily swings the rock at him again, and as Thorin dodges, the rock smashes into the ice, cracking it.]

[Meanwhile, Bolg throws a huge stone at Legolas, and it smashes the bridge beneath him. In an amazing and inhuman feat of agility, Legolas manages to run up falling rocks and leaps at Bolg. As they fight, Legolas manages to stab at Bolg, but Bolg grabs the knife between his arm and armor, just like in their encounter in Laketown. This time, though, Legolas smiles and uses the knife as leverage to swing atop Bolg’s shoulder; he then stabs Bolg through the top of the head, killing him; Legolas leaps back onto land as the bridge falls to the ground, carrying Bolg’s body with it. Legolas looks for Tauriel, but doesn’t see her.] 

[Legolas:] “Tauriel!”

[As Thorin and Azog fight, the ice continues cracking. They both pause for a second, then Azog swings again. This time, the ice actually begins to break apart beneath them. As Thorin stumbles over an edge of the ice, Azog manages to knock his legs out from under him with the chain. As Azog swings again, Thorin manages to roll away. He leaps behind Azog, who is off balance, and slashes him again. Azog angrily swings the rock and chain at Thorin, missing; this time, the rock becomes stuck in the ice, and Azog is forced to slash at Thorin with his bladed arm. Suddenly, Azog looks into the sky behind Thorin in shock; we see the Eagles, with Radagast riding their leader, swoop by. They sail through the ranks of the oncoming orc reinforcements from Gundabad, decimating them. Beorn, riding atop one of the Eagles, throws himself off it and transforms into a bear as he falls to the ground, landing in full massive bear form right in the middle of the orcs. He smashes through them.]

[Meanwhile, Thorin suddenly throws his sword down. Reaching forward, he lifts the rock at the end of the chain and tosses it to Azog, who instinctively catches it. Azog looks at him in shock. Thorin jumps backward, off the ice floe that they were both standing on; without his weight to balance it, and with Azog at the other end holding the rock, the ice floe tips over and plunges Azog into the water below. He scrabbles at the edge, but the chain pulls him down. Thorin pants in exhaustion.]

[The Eagles attack the werebats, ripping them out of the air. As Thorin bends down to pick up Orcrist, he sees Azog through the ice, being pulled slowly by the current toward the frozen waterfall. Thorin slowly walks above him, and they stare at each other through the ice. Azog closes his eyes. Suddenly, he opens them, and he manages to stab Thorin through the foot, through the ice, with his blade arm. He leaps through the ice and pins Thorin down. As he stabs his blade arm at Thorin, Thorin manages to stop it from piercing his chest by sliding Orcrist in one of the forks of the blade. Azog, using gravity and his superior weight and position, slowly pushes his blade further and further, and Thorin struggles to keep it away. As they stare at each other, Thorin suddenly slides his sword out of the fork, allowing Azog’s blade to stab him through the chest. As Azog smiles, Thorin raises his own sword and stabs Azog through the heart; from their close quarters, Azog cannot avoid it. Thorin flips Azog over onto his back on the ice and forces Orcrist all the way through Azog and through the ice below. Azog dies, with Thorin kneeling on top of him. Thorin, mortally wounded, struggles to get up.]

[Bilbo, waking up from unconsciousness, sees the Eagles overhead.]

[Bilbo:] “The eagles are coming…”

[Thorin stumbles toward the edge of the frozen waterfall, looking out over the battlefield below, where the remaining orcs are being routed. Weak from his wound, he collapses on his back. Bilbo comes running up in surprise.]

[Thorin:] “Bilbo…”

[Bilbo:] “Don’t move! Don’t move! Lie still!

[Bilbo examines Thorin’s wound, then recoils in shock.]

[Bilbo:] “Oh!

[Thorin:] “I’m glad you’re here…

[Bilbo:] “Shh.”

[Thorin:] “I wish to part from you in friendship.”

[Bilbo:] “No. You are not going anywhere, Thorin. You’re going to live.”

[Thorin:] “I would take back my words and my deeds at the gate. You did what only a true friend would do. Forgive me...I was too  blind to see. I’m so sorry that I have led you into such peril.”

[Thorin begins choking up blood.]

[Bilbo:] “No, no, I’m glad to have shared in all your perils, Thorin - each and every one of them. And it’s far more than any Baggins deserve.”

[They smile at each other.]

[Thorin:] “Farewell, Master Burglar. Go back to your books and your armchair. Plant your trees - watch them grow.”

[Thorin struggles to choke.]

[Thorin:] “If more people valued home above gold this world would be a merrier place.”

[Thorin gasps deeply, then begins to expire.]

[Bilbo:] “No! No! No! No! No! No! Thorin! Oh don’t you dare!”

[Thorin breathes out his last and dies.]

[Bilbo:] “Thorin, Thorin, wake up. The eagles...the eagles...the eagles are here. Thorin...the eag…”

[Bilbo cries in sorrow.]



[Tauriel, heartbroken, places Kili’s stone in his dead hand, as Legolas watches.]



[Thranduil walks slowly through the ruins of Ravenhill, gazing about at the carnage. Legolas approaches him.]

[Legolas:] “I...cannot go back.”

[Legolas brushes past his father and prepares to leave.]

[Thranduil:] “Where will you go?”

[Legolas turns and faces Thranduil.] 

[Legolas:] “I do not know.”

[Thranduil:] “Go north. Find the Dúnedain. There’s a young Ranger amongst them- you should meet him. His father, Arathorn, was a good man. His son might grow to be a great one.”

[Legolas:] “What is his name?”

[Thranduil:] “He’s known in the wild as Strider. His true name you must discover for yourself.”

[They nod at each other, then Legolas turns and walks away. Thranduil calls after him, and Legolas pauses.]

[Thranduil:] “Legolas... your mother loved you...more than anyone...more than life.”

[Legolas opens his eyes open in shock and surprise. Legolas and Thranduil make a gesture of departure to each other, then Legolas leaves. Thranduil watches him leave sadly, bowing his head in grief. He then proceeds through the ruins and finds Tauriel still next to Kili’s body.]

[Tauriel:] “They want to bury him.”

[Thranduil:] “Yes…”

[Tauriel:] “If this is love, I do not want it.”

[Heartbrokenly, Tauriel pleads with Thranduil.]

[Tauriel:] “Take it from me, please! Why does it hurt so much?”

[Thranduil approaches her slowly with an understanding look in his eyes.]

[Thranduil:] “Because it was real.”

[Tauriel looks up at him in shock. After thinking for a while, she kisses Kili one last time.]



[Bilbo is sitting by himself and staring off into the distance; Gandalf comes to join him. They sit there, quietly, thinking. Gandalf begins cleaning out his pipe quite noisily, and Bilbo looks like he’s about to object. After a moment’s pause, they nod at each other.]

[The remaining members of Thorin’s company kneel beside the body of their King, paying him homage. Bilbo and Gandalf, sitting, watch.]

[In Dale, Percy blows on a huge horn, and all the townspeople, who are gathered along the walls, stare out reverently at Erebor; this is presumably during Thorin’s funeral.]



[Bilbo and Balin walk out of the gates of Erebor; Bilbo is wearing his pack and is prepared to leave. Balin tries to persuade him to stay.]

[Balin:] “There is to be a great feast tonight. Songs will be song, tales will be told and Thorin Oakenshield will pass into legend.”

[Bilbo:] “I know that’s how you must honor him, but to me he was never that - he was...to me...he was…”

[Bilbo is unable to find the words, and Balin smiles fondly at him.]

[Bilbo:] “Well, I think I’ll slip quietly away. Will you tell we others I said goodbye?”

[Balin:] “You can tell’ em yourself.”

[Bilbo looks back and smiles as he sees the other dwarves standing behind him. He speaks to all of them.]

[Bilbo:] “If any of you ever passing Bag End, tea is at four - there’s plenty of it. You are welcome anytime.”

[The dwarves bow to him, and he smiles. He begins to turn away, then turns back.]

[Bilbo:] “Eh, don’t bother knocking.”

[The dwarves chuckle, some of them wiping away tears. Bilbo, after waving goodbye, walks toward Gandalf, who is waiting with his horse and a pony for Bilbo.]

[They ride slowly back toward the Shire, admiring the scenery as they go.]



[They dismount at the edge of the Shire, and Bilbo begins to walk with all his things in his arms.]

[Gandalf:] “Ah, the borders of the Shire. It is here I must leave you.”

[Bilbo:] “That’s a shame. I quite liked having a wizard around. Seems they bring good luck.”

[Gandalf:] “You don’t really suppose, do you, that all your adventures and escapes were managed by mere luck?”

[Gandalf looks knowingly at Bilbo.]

[Gandalf:] “Magic rings should not be used lightly, Bilbo.”

[Bilbo begins to protest, but Gandalf interrupts him.]

[Gandalf:] “Don’t take me for a fool - I know you found one in the Goblin tunnels...and I’ve kept my eye on you ever since.”

[Now that the secret is out, Bilbo smiles.]

[Bilbo:] “Well, thank goodness.”

[Bilbo:] “Farewell, Gandalf.”

[They clasp hands and look each other in the eye.]

[Gandalf:] “Farewell.”

[Bilbo turns and walks away; after a few paces, he stops and turns.]

[Bilbo:] “You, uh...you needn’t worry about that ring. It fell out of my pocket during the battle. I lost it.”

[Gandalf:] “You’re a very fine person, Mister Baggins. And I’m very fond of you. But you’re only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all.” 

[Bilbo continues walking back to the Shire, and Gandalf goes back the way he came.]



[As Bilbo climbs over the last hill before Hobbiton, he sees a lot of activity near Bag End, across the valley. As he walks up the path toward his house, he sees many hobbits passing in the opposite direction as him carrying various articles of furniture and other household articles.]
 
[Bilbo:] “Wait a minute...that’s my mother’s glory box. And that’s...my dining chair.”

[He sees a hobbit carrying a pouf (ottoman) on his shoulder.]

[Bilbo:] “Ah! Put that pouf down! What is going on?!”

[A hobbit with a wheelbarrow full of things stops to greet him cheerfully.]

[Hobbit:] “Hello, Mister Bilbo!” 

[Suddenly, he realizes who he is talking to and looks surprised.]

[Hobbit:] “...You’re not supposed to be here.”

[Bilbo:] “What do you mean?”

[Hobbit:] “On account of you being presumed dead and all.”

[Bilbo:] “I am not dead! Presumed or otherwise!”

[Bilbo turns and hurries up the hill toward Bag End, passing more and more hobbits carrying his things.]

[Hobbit:] “I’m not sure that’s permitted, Mister Bilbo!”

[In front of Bag End, and auctioneer is auctioning off Bilbo’s things. A sign reads: “For sale, by auction. The effects and estate of the late Mr. Bilbo Baggins, esq. 10 o’clock sharp, June the 22nd. Messrs Grubb, Grubb and Burrowes. Registered Auctioneers.]

[Auctioneer:]  “Twenty-one! Haha! Sold to Mrs. Bolger! Somewhere for Fatty to put his feet on, haha!”

[Auctioneer:]  “Do I have any bids for this? This is Shire-made. None of your dwarvish reproductions here.”

[Auctioneer:] “Our next bid…”

[Bilbo, running up, interrupts him.]

[Bilbo:] “Stop! Stop! There’s been a mistake!”

[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins:] “Who are you?”  

[Bilbo:] “What do you mean who am I?! - You know bloody well who I am, Lobelia Sackville-Baggins! This is my home! And those are my spoons. Thank you very much!”

[Bilbo takes back some spoons that Lobelia had just bought at the auction.]

[Auctioneer:]  “This is most irregular. Excuse me, it’s been more than thirteen months since the disappearance. If you are, in fact, Bilbo Baggins and undeceased - can you prove it?”

[Bilbo:] “What?!”

[Auctioneer:]  “Oh, well, something official with your name on it would suffice.”

[Bilbo is, justifiably, quite flustered.]

[Bilbo:] “Alright! Right.”

[He pulls out the contract that he’d signed to join Thorin’s company and looks through it.]

[Bilbo:] “A contract...of employment as a...a...nevermind as what.”

[He shows it to the auctioneer.]

[Bilbo:] “There! My signature!”

[Auctioneer:]  “Uh, certainly seems to be in order. Yes, seems there can be no doubt.”

[As the auctioneer is reading, Bilbo mounts the steps to his house.]

[Auctioneer:]  “Who is this person you pledged your service to?”

[Bilbo pauses at the door.]

[Auctioneer:]  “...Thorin Oakenshield.”

[Bilbo looks sad.]

[Bilbo:] “He- he was my friend.”

[Opening the door, Bilbo walks in to find his house a mess, with items strewn all across the floor. As he walks about, he finds a handkerchief with his initials, BB, on it. He looks up and smiles. Finding a picture of his mother on the floor, he puts it back up on the wall next to the picture of his father; he straightens it out. He steps back and looks at it. As he inspects his handiwork, he puts his hands in his waistcoat pocket, but then pulls them out quickly when he feels his ring. He hesitates to put his hand back in his pocket, going back and forth. Eventually, he pulls it out and looks at it.]



[We see the hand holding the ring; it is now much older. We see that it is the present time, and Bilbo is quite old. A knock sounds at the door, and Bilbo clutches the ring tightly. He yells out.]

[Bilbo:] “No, thank you! We don’t want any more visitors, well-wishers or distant relations!”

[The voice of Gandalf is heard from outside.]

[Gandalf:] “And what about very old friends?!”

[Bilbo smiles broadly and hurries to open the door. We hear him and Gandalf talking in the background as the camera pans to one of Bilbo’s maps of Middle Earth, eventually centering on the Lonely Mountain.]

[Bilbo:] “Gandalf?!”

[Gandalf:] “Bilbo Baggins.”

[Bilbo:] “My dear Gandalf!”

[Gandalf:] “Good to see you. One hundred eleven years old - who’d believe it?" 

[Bilbo:] “Come on, come in! Welcome, welcome!”


 
[As the credits roll, Billy Boyd’s song “The Last Goodbye” plays.]

          A last alliance of Men and Elves marched
          against the armies of Mordor.

                    [Galadriel:] (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          On the slopes of Mount Doom they fought
          for the freedom of Middle- Earth.

father in his arms. The SHADOW OF SAURON falls over him...

                    [Galadriel:] (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          It was in this moment..when all hope had
          faded, that Isildur, son of the king,
          took up his father's sword.

ISILDUR snatches up the BROKEN BLADE OF NARSIL..The BLADE
severs SAURON'S FINGERS... AND THE ONE RING FLIES from his
body.

                    [Galadriel:] (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of
          Middle Earth, was defeated. SAURON'S
          ARMOR clatters to the ground. His body

GONE....VAPORIZED! CLOSE ON: ISILDUR picks up the SEVERED
FINGER and removes the ONE RING...transfixed!

            will of its own.

SCREAMS!

slowly from his finger. Ripples of LIGHT play across
ISILDUR'S PALE FACE...he is DEAD.

                      [Galadriel:] (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            It betrayed Isildur to his death.

          took it deep into the tunnels of the
          Misty Mountains.

          It came to me. My own.     My love...

          My preciousness.

                    [Galadriel:] (V.O.)
          The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long
          life. For five hundred years it poisoned
          his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's

STILL...the unsettled quiet before the storm...

          Darkness crept back into the forests of
          the world. Rumor grew of a Shadow in the
          East...whispers of a nameless fear. And
          the Ring of Power perceived...its time
          had now come. It abandoned Gollum.

A YOUNGISH LOOKING BILBO BAGGINS peers down at what lies in
his hand...PERPLEXED by what he has found.

                      [Galadriel:] (V.O.)
            A Hobbit....Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

                      [Bilbo:]
                (surprised)
            A Ring.

SUDDENLY!   A VOICE SCREAMS...ITS ANGUISH RINGING through the

COLD, DANK TUNNELS...

                       [Gollum:] (V.O.)
            Lost!   Lost! My Precious is lost!!

Frightened Bilbo quickly POCKETS the ONE RING and hurries on.

CONTINUED:

White flowers are scattered among the Well seeded grasses.
An idyllic setting at the end of a long hot summer... the
figure is reading a book. ON THE SOUNDTRACK: In the distance,
growing louder..over the Gentle clip clop of an approaching
cart and horse can be heard the HUMMING OF A DEEP VOICE to
the tune of "The Road Goes Ever On and On..."

SUDDENLY! The figure in the grass sits up...looking straight
at camera is a handsome young HOBBIT, with dark curly hair
and deep blue eyes. This is FRODO BAGGINS...his EYES alight
with EXCITEMENT! Tossing away the long stem of grass in his
mouth, Frodo runs off.

The cart rattles along a leafy lane, driven by a stooped
figure in Grey.

INTERCUT WITH; SHOTS OF FRODO RUNNING... CAREERING DOWN A

HILL. . .JUMPING OVER LOGS... DODGING TREE BRANCHES.

The shambling OLD PONY snorts and rears as... SUDDENLY FRODO
appears on a bank above the cart.

                    [Frodo:]
          You're late.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF glowers at the young Hobbit...

                    [Gandalf:]
          A Wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins,
          nor is he early. He arrives precisely
          when he means to.

They look at each other a moment..then both start laughing as
FRODO'S face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to the front
seat of the cart.

                    [Frodo:]
          It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

Next to Gandalf, we see how small Hobbits are...Frodo is 3
foot 6 inches tall.

                    [Gandalf:]
          You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle

EXT. HOBBITON FIELDS -- DAY

Wide on: The cart rattles past a FIELD LUPIN being tended by

HOBBITS.

           What news of the outside world? Tell me
           everything!

                                                       ANGLE ON:

Gandalf looks down at Frodo, a twinkle in his eye.

                     [Gandalf:]
           What, everything? Far too eager and
           curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural...

Wide on: The cart rattles over a Stone bridge towards a Busy
Hobbit Marketplace.

                      [Gandalf:] (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Well, what can I tell you? Life in the
           wide world goes on much as if it has past
           age. Full of its own comings and goings,
           scarcely even aware of the existence of
           Hobbits...

Close on: Gandalf as he surveys the peaceful scene before
him.

                     [Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
           ...for which I am very thankful.

Hobbits look up exclaiming in wonder and excitement as the
cart bearing Gandalf and Frodo rolls past the Green Dragon
Inn...towards... Wide on: The party field. Where scores of
Hobbits are busy preparing for the big night.

                     [Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
           Ah, the long expected party. So, how is
           the old rascal? I hear it's going to be
           a Party of Special Magnificence.

                     [Frodo:]
           You know Bilbo...he's got he whole place
           in an uproar.

          He's up to something.

                    [Gandalf:]
          Oh, really?

Frodo shoots a knowing look, as Gandalf averts his eyes.

                    [Frodo:]
          Alright then..keep your secrets. Before
          you came along we Bagginses were very
          well thought of.

                       [Gandalf:]
          Indeed?

                    [Frodo:]
          Never had any adventures or did anything
          unexpected.

                    [Gandalf:]
          If you're referring to the incident with
          the Dragon...I was barely involved...all
          I did was give your Uncle a little nudge
          out the door.

                    [Frodo:]
          Whatever you did...you've been officially
          labelled as a Disturber of the Peace.

                    [Gandalf:]
          Oh, really?

ODO PROUDFOOT looks up as the Cart passes by, deeply
suspicious.

As the cart rattles into the small village of Hobbiton...a
quaint rustic settlement, nestled amongst rolling green hills

The Hobbits live in Hobbit Holes: neat burrows dug into the
grassy hillside, with round doors and cute front gardens.

Excited children, chasing after the cart.

                                                     CLOSE ON:

Gandalf ignores the children's cries. The children stand
deflated, watching Gandalf disappear up the lane. At that
moment: spinning balls of bright color suddenly leap out of
the cart, fizzing over the heads of the delighted children.

                                                     ANGLE ON:

Gandalf smiling to himself, well pleased with his joke. ODO
PROUDFOOT is unable to suppress a chuckle. Frodo stands up in
the cart as Gandalf reigns in the horse.

                    [Frodo:]
          Gandalf... I'm glad you're back. Frodo
          leaps expertly from the cart. Gandalf
          smiles.

EXT. BAG END -- DAY

Wide on: GANDALF'S CART pulls up outside the gate to BAG
END...a particularly fine example of a Hobbit hole, with a
large round front door set into a grassy hillside. There is
a sign on the gate which reads: "NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON
PARTY BUSINESS." Gandalf strides up to the garden path of Bag
End. He raises his staff and raps on the front door...a
voice calls out:

                     [Bilbo:] (O.S.)
          No, thank you! We don't want any more
          visitors, well wishers, or distant
          relations.

                    [Gandalf:]
          And what about very old friends?

Suddenly the door opens and BILBO BAGGINS stands before him.
He is a HOBBIT OF INDERTIMINATE AGE, with a mischievous
Twinkle in his eye. Wearing a dashing brocade waist coat, he
looks every inch the eccentric gentleman.

          Gandalf?

                    [Gandalf:]
          Bilbo Baggins!

                    [Bilbo:]
          My dear Gandalf!

Gandalf drops to his knee to embrace his old friend.

                    [Gandalf:]
          It's good to see you. One hundred and
          eleven years old, who would believe it!

Gandalf looks at him more keenly.

                    [Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
          You haven't aged a day! Gandalf and Bilbo
          laugh together and enter Bag End.

                    [Bilbo:]
          Come on, come in!   Welcome, welcome!!

                                                        CUT TO:

INT. BAG END LIVING ROOM -- DAY

Bilbo leads Gandalf into Bag End...cozy and cluttered with
souvenirs of Bilbo's travels. Gandalf has to stoop to avoid
hitting his head on the low ceiling. Bilbo hangs up Gandalf's
hat on a peg and trots off down the hall.

                    [Bilbo:]
              (Calling)
          Tea? Or maybe something stronger... I've
          a few bottles of the Old Winyard left,
          1296...a very good year, almost as old as
          I am. It was laid down by my father. What
          say we open one, eh?

Bilbo disappears into the kitchen as Gandalf looks
around..enjoying the familiarity of Bag End...he turns,
knocking his head on the light and then walking into the
wooden beam. He groans.

                    [Bilbo:] (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          I was expecting you some time last week.
          Not that it matters, you come and go as
          you please, always have done, always
          will.

CONTINUED:
                    [Bilbo:] (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          You've caught me a bit unprepared, I'm
          afraid...we've only got cold chicken, bit
          of pickle, some cheese here...ooh, no,
          that might be a little risky...

Gandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one
corner...it is Thorin's map of the Lonely Mountain, Gandalf
smiles to himself.

                    [Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
          Er, we've got raspberry jam and apple
          tart...got some custard somewhere. Not
          much for Afters, I'm afraid. Oh
          no...we're alright...I've just found some
          sponge cake. Nice little snack. Hope
          it's enough.
              (comes into view)
          I could do you some eggs if you like?

Bilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as Gandalf
mysteriously appears behind him.

                    [Gandalf:]
          Just tea, thank you.

                       [Bilbo:]
          Oh..right.     You don't mind if...?

                    [Gandalf:]
          No, not at all. Go ahead. A sudden loud
          knock on the front door.

MRS. SACKVILLE BAGGINS (O.S.)

Bilbo Baggins, you open this door..I know you're in there.

                    [Bilbo:]
          I'm not home.

Gandalf watches, amused as Bilbo tries to hide.

                    [Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
          I've got to get away from these
          confounded relatives, hanging on the bell
          all day, never giving me a moment's
          peace. I want to see mountains
          again...mountains, Gandalf... and then
          find somewhere quiet where I can finish
          my book...Oh, Tea!

                    [Gandalf:]
          So, you mean to go through with your
          plan, then?

CONTINUED:


                    [Bilbo:]
          Yes, yes...it's all inhand.   All the
          arrangements are made.

                    [Gandalf:]
          Frodo suspects something.

                    [Bilbo:]
          'Course he does, he's a Baggins...not
          some block headed Bracegirdle from
          Hardbottle!

                    [Gandalf:]
          You will tell him, won't you?

                      [Bilbo:]
          Yes, yes.

                    [Gandalf:]
          He's very fond of you.

                    [Bilbo:]
          I know. He'd probably come with me if I
          asked him. I think, in his heart,
          Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the
          woods and the fields... little rivers.
          Bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen
          window.

                    [Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
          I am old, Gandalf... Bilbo looks at
          Gandalf sadly...

                    [Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
          I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning
          to feel it in my heart.

                                                      CLOSE ON:

Bilbo's fingers close around his waistcoat pocket...gripping
a small, unseen object.

                    [Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
          I feel thin...sort of stretched, like
          butter scraped over too much bread. I
          need a holiday...a very long holiday and
          I don't expect I shall return...in fact,
          I mean not to.

INT. BAG END -- EVENING

Gandalf and Bilbo are sitting on the Bag End porch. Below
them, final preparations are being made on the Party field.
Bilbo strikes a match and lights his pipe.

                    [Bilbo:]
          Old Toby, the finest weed in
          Southfarthing!

Bilbo blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the
air. A tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through
the Center of Bilbo's smoke ring.

                    [Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
          Ohhhh,
              (smiles)
          Gandalf my old friend...this will be a
          night to remember!

                                                      CUT TO:

EXT. PARTY FIELD, HOBBITON -- NIGHT

BOOM! A FIREWORK explodes into the night sky high above
Hobbiton...in the shape of a great green tree with unfolding
branches. TILT DOWN: with glowing flowers as they rain down
from the branches...evaporating just above the up turned
faces of the delighted party-goers 144 Hobbits, feasting and
drinking Carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the
tables are piled high with steaming scones and savories.
Gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark
that dances magically from his staff... Bilbo is greeting
visitors. Frodo and SAM sit at a table drinking ale...Frodo
notices Sam's eyes keep flicking to another pretty Hobbit,
Rosie Cotton, sitting some distance away.

                    [Frodo:]
          Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.

                     [Sam:]
               (horrified)
          I think I'll just have myself another
          ale.

                    [Frodo:]
          Oh, no you don't. Go on.

Sam goes to drain his glass... suddenly it is snatched out of
his hands as Frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing
throng of dancers.

                                                            15.



ANGLE ON: SAM'S HORRIFIED FACE

as he is Swept away.   Frodo laughs and finishes Sam's beer.

                                                      ANGLE ON:

Gandalf as he sets alight a particularly spectacular firework
that draws gasps of admiration from the party guests.

Close on: Bilbo is relating stories of his adventure to a
group of young hobbit children.

                    [Bilbo:]
              (melodramatic)
          So, there I was...at the mercy of three
          monstrous trolls...Have you ever heard of
          a troll? Do you know what a Troll is?
          Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly
          things..and they're arguing...arguing
          about how they were going to cook us!

ANGLE ON: A LITTLE HOBBIT GIRL'S

upturned face...her eyes growing larger and larger.

                    [Bilbo:]
          Whether it be turned on a spit or minced
          in a pie or whether they were going to
          sit on us one by one and squash us into
          jelly! But they spent so long arguing
          the whether-to's and why-for's that the
          sun's first light crept over the top of
          the trees...and turned them all to stone!

STUNNED GASPS from his young Audience greet his astonishing
feat! Close on: MERRY AND PIPPIN, two mischievous Young
Hobbits in their late teens. Pippin scrambles on to the back
of Gandalf's wagon, snatching up a small firework

                    [Merry:]
              (urgent whisper)
          No, no..the big one...the big one! Pippin
          grabs a huge rocket. CLOSE ON: FIREWORK
          FUSE crackles with flame!

Merry is holding out the big rocket...he looks aghast at the
fizzing fuse that Pippin has just lit.

                    [Merry:] (CONT'D)
              (worried whisper)
          You're supposed to stick it in the
          ground!


                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           16.
CONTINUED:


                    [Pippin:]
          It is in the ground.

Merry fearfully tosses the Rocket to Pippin!    The fuse
sizzles angrily.

                     [Merry:]
          Outside!

                    [Pippin:]
          It was your idea.

Pippin attempts to throw the fizzing rocket back to Merry.
WHOOSH! The two hobbits are suddenly blown off their feet in
a shower of sparks as the rocket blasts off with frightening
power. The ROCKET ZOOMS over the Party..It suddenly bursts
apart, forming the shape of a great red golden Dragon! Fire
gushes from its nostrils as it turns back and Flies low
towards the startled crowd. Close on: Frodo watches the
Fireworks Dragon with alarm...but Bilbo is oblivious to the
Panicking crowd and impending danger!

                     [Frodo:]
          Bilbo!   Watch out for the dragon!!

                    [Bilbo:]
          Dragon? Nonsense...hasn1t been a dragon
          in these parts for a thousand years!

ANGLE ON: FRODO

As he hurriedly pulls Bilbo to the ground, just as the dragon
roars a few feet above their heads like a flaming express
train! Hobbits dive to the ground, tables overturn, tents
collapse, food flies everywhere. The fireworks dragon turns a
somersault and explodes over the hills with a deafening bang!
This gets the biggest Cheer of the night.

ANGLE ON: MERRY AND PIPPIN,

clothes and hair smoking.

                    [Merry:]
          That was good!

                    [Pippin:]
          Let's get another one!

LARGE HANDS suddenly clamp down on Merry and Pippin's ears.
Low angle: Gandalf looking DOWN STERNLY!

                                                        CUT TO:

MERRY AND PIPPIN

Are leaning over a barrel, washing dishes in soapy
water...with Gandalf sitting nearby, smoking his pipe and
sipping an ale. Cries of "SPEECH! SPEECH" erupt from the
party.

                                                      ANGLE ON:

Bilbo stepping on a stool...he bows in gratitude at the
applause.

                       [Frodo:]
          Speech!

                    [Bilbo:]
              (clearing throat)
          My dear Bagginses, and Boffins, tooks and
          Brandybucks...Grubbs, Chubbs,
          Hornblowers, Bolgers, Bracegirdles and
          Proudfoots...

ANGLE ON: A HOBBIT WITH PARTICULARLY BIG FEET

                       ODO PROUDFOOT
          Proudfeet!

                    [Bilbo:]
          Today is my one hundred and eleventh
          birthday. Yes, and alas...Eleventy- one
          years is far too short a time to live
          among such excellent and admirable
          Hobbits! Tremendous outburst of approval!

                    [Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
          I don't know half of you half as well as
          I should like; and I like less than half
          of you as well as well as you deserve.

SCATTERED CLAPPING as the guests try to work out if that was
a compliment or not. CLOSE ON: FRODO AND GANDALF smiling to
themselves. CLOSE ON: Bilbo...a strange hum seems to fill his
head. A bead of sweat rolls down his brow.

Bilbo's hand pulls something out of his waistcoat pocket and
holds it behind his back.


                                                 (CONTINUED)

                    [Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
          I have..things to do and I have put this
          off for far too long... CLOSE ON: BILBO'S
          knuckles turn white as he tightens his
          grip on the small object behind his back.

                    [Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
          I regret to announce, this is the end. I
          am going now. I bid you all a very fond
          farewell!! Bilbo looks across at Frodo,
          hesitates... then...

                    [Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
              (whisper)
          Goodbye.

Bilbo instantly vanishes. The party explodes into an
uproar... the crowd leaps to its feet.

ANGLE ON: FRODO

staring at the empty stool in disbelief.

                                                        CUT TO:

EXT. BAG END -- NIGHT

The party is still in an excited uproar... some 50 yards away
as we pan across a moonlit lane to the front door of Bag End.
Door opens, pulled by an invisible hand.

INT. BAG END -- NIGHT

The door quietly closes...Bilbo materializes as he pulls a
plain gold ring off his finger. Bilbo laughs as he tosses the
ring in the air, then places it in his pocket.

                                                      ANGLE ON:

Bilbo emerges from the passage, carrying a walking stick. He
finds Gandalf looming over him.

                    [Gandalf:]
          I suppose you think that was terribly
          clever?

                    [Bilbo:]
          Come on, Gandalf!   Did you see their
          faces?

CONTINUED:


                    [Gandalf:]
          There are many magic rings in the world,
          Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be
          used lightly.

                    [Bilbo:]
          It was just a bit of fun.   Oh, you're
          probably right as usual.

                    [Gandalf:]
          You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?

                    [Bilbo:]
          I'm leaving everything to him.

                    [Gandalf:]
          What about this ring of yours?   Is that
          staying too?

Close on: Bilbo...he gives Gandalf a look and nods toward the
mantelpiece.

                    [Bilbo:]
          Yes, yes, it's in an envelope...over
          there on the mantelpiece. Gandalf frowns
          at the empty mantelpiece...Bilbo suddenly
          feels his waistcoat with a look of guilty
          surprise.

                    [Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
          No, wait. It's here in my pocket. Isn't
          that...isn't' that odd now? Yet, after
          all, why not? Why shouldn't I keep it?

                    [Gandalf:]
          I think you should leave the Ring behind,
          Bilbo. Is that so hard?

                    [Bilbo:]
          Well, no...and yes. Now it comes to it,
          I don't feel like parting with it. It's
          mine. I found it. It came to me!

ANGLE ON: GANDALF LOOKS DOWN AT BILBO WITH RISING CONCERN.

                    [Gandalf:]
          There's no need to get angry.

                    [Bilbo:]
          Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault! It's
          mine. My own, my precious.

                    [Gandalf:]
          Precious? It's been called that before,
          but not by you.

                    [Bilbo:]
          So? What business is it of yours what I
          do with my own things? Bilbo's voice,
          shape and manner have suddenly changed.

                    [Gandalf:]
          I think you've had that ring quite long
          enough.

                    [Bilbo:]
          You want it for yourself!

Gandalf rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow
suddenly seems to fill the room

                    [Gandalf:]
          Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some
          conjurer of cheap tricks! Bilbo cowers
          from Gandalf, disarmed by his power...a
          frightened Hobbit. Gandalf's expression
          softens.

                    [Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
          I am not trying to rob you. I am trying
          to help you. Sobbing, Bilbo runs to
          Gandalf and hugs him.

                    [Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
          All you long years we've been
          friends...trust me as you once did. Let
          it go!

                    [Bilbo:]
          You're right, Gandalf...the ring must go
          to Frodo.

Bilbo lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door.

                    [Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
          It's late, the road is long... yes, it is
          time.

                    [Gandalf:]
          Bilbo?

                    [Bilbo:]
          Hmmm?

Bilbo hesitates...reaches into his pocket.

                     [Bilbo:]
          Oh, yes.

CLOSE ON: Bilbo pulls out the ring...he stares at it in his
palm. With all his will power, Bilbo allows the ring to
slowly slide off his palm and drop to the floor. CLOSE ON:
The tiny ring lands with a heavy thud on the wooden floor.

EXT. BAG END -- NIGHT

Bilbo staggering out of Bag end...he braces himself in the
night air, Pale and Trembling, as if his loss of the ring has
weakened him. Gandalf steps up behind.

                    [Bilbo:]
          I've thought up and ending for my
          book..."And he lived happily ever after
          to the end of his days."

                    [Gandalf:]
          I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

                    [Bilbo:]
          Goodbye, Gandalf.

                    [Gandalf:]
          Goodbye Bilbo.

Bilbo walks away from Bag End, disappearing into the night,
softly singing: "The Road goes on and on."

              (softly)
          Until our next meeting.

INT. BAG END LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

CLOSE ON: THE RING...Glinting on the floor...Gandalf circles
around it, a Puzzled look on his face. Gandalf slowly reaches
for the ring. His fingers barely touch the ring...the creepy
Hum rises on the soundtrack. Gandalf is sitting in front of
the fire, with his pipe...staring into the flickering flames.

          Bilbo! Bilbo!

Frodo rushes into Bag End...he stops and picks up the ring at
his feet. Gandalf continues staring into the fire, as if
locked in thought.

                    [Gandalf:]
              (to himself)

          He's gone, hasn't he? Frodo steps into
          the living room.

                    [Frodo:] (CONT'D)
          He talked for so long about leaving...I
          didn't think he'd really do it.

                     [Gandalf:]

Gandalf turns...his eyes locking onto the ring in Frodo's
fingers.

          Bilbo's ring.

Gandalf sorts hurriedly through Bilbo's papers...

          He's gone to stay with the Elves. He's
          left you Bag End...

Gandalf holds out the envelope...Frodo drops the ring into
it.

                    [Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
          ...along with all his possessions.

Gandolf seals the envelope with wax.   He hands it to Frodo.

                    [Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
          The ring is yours now. But it somewhere
          out of sight. Gandalf rises hurriedly and
          starts to gather his things.

                    [Frodo:]
          Where are you going?

                    [Gandalf:]
          I have some things I must see to.

                    [Frodo:]
          What things?

                       [Gandalf:]
          Questions.     Questions that need
          answering.

                    [Frodo:]
          You've only just arrived!    I don't
          understand...

Gandalf is already at the door, he turns to Frodo.

                    [Gandalf:]
          Neither do I. Keep it secret, keep it
          safe.

Gandalf hurries out the door...leaving FRODO standing alone
in the Bag End.

          ring to cover all the lands in the second
          darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it,
          all his thought is bent on it. For the
          ring yearns, above all else, to return to
          the hand of its master: they are one, the
          ring and the dark lord. Frodo, he must
          never find out. SUDDENLY Frodo scoops up
          the Ring.

                    [Saruman:]
          The hour is later than you think.
          Sauron's forces are already moving...the
          Nine have left Minas Morgul.

                    [Gandalf:]
              (shocked)
          The nine!

                    [Saruman:]
          They crossed the river Isen in
          Midsummer's eve, disguised as riders in
          black.

                    [Gandalf:]
              (alarmed)
          They have reached the Shire? Saruman
          shrugs...

                    [Saruman:]
          They will find the ring...and kill the
          one who carries it.

Gandalf backs away and turns to run to the door...horrified
as the doors suddenly slam shut.

                    [Saruman:] (CONT'D)
          You did not seriously think a Hobbit
          could contend with the will of Sauron?
          There are none who can.

Gandalf slowly turns to Saruman...a look of dawning horror.

                    [Saruman:] (CONT'D)
          Against the power of Mordor, there can be
          no victory. We must join with him,
          Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It
          would be wise, my friend.

                    [Gandalf:]
              (deadly)
          Tell me, friend, when did Saruman the
          wise abandon reason for madness?

At that moment: Gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room!
He slams against the wall...pinned there by some unseen
force. With sudden effort, Gandalf wrenches himself off the
wall and swings his staff on Saruman...blasting him off his
feet! Gandalf and Saruman battle, powerful blasts throwing
them across the room. [Saruman:] SCREAMS, EYES BLAZING!
Gandalf's staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp...it
flies across the chamber into Saruman's hand! Gandalf is
flung to the floor.

                    [Saruman:]
          I gave you the chance of aiding me
          willingly, but you have elected the way
          of pain.

Gandalf is breathing hard on the floor, his eyes look into
the madness of Saruman... Commanding two staffs, Saruman
sends Gandalf into a sickening spin. Gandalf tumbles towards
the top of the chamber...as if falling in reverse. Rushing
POV: the roof of Orthanc rockets toward camera.

EXT. FARMER'S FIELDS -- DAY

Wide on: Frodo and Sam walking along a country lane which
borders Farmer Maggot's Fields. Sam is looking up...Frodo has
disappeared around a corner in the lane.

          Mr. Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo turns,
          surprised as Sam comes running towards
          him.

                    [Sam:] (CONT'D)
              (worried)
          I thought I lost you. Frodo looks at Sam
          suspiciously. Sam glances down,
          embarrassed.

          It's just something Gandalf said...

          What did he say?

                    [Sam:]
          He said..."Don't you leave him, Samwise
          Gamgee."
              (looks at Frodo intently)
          And I don't mean to.

SUDDENLY! A figure comes crashing out of a hedgerow sending
Frodo flying. Frodo picks himself up, only to be knocked back
down again by Pippin.

                     [Pippin:]
          Frodo!   Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.

                    [Merry:]
          Hello Frodo

Merry, Pippin, and Frodo picking themselves up... a variety
of vegetables have scattered everywhere.

                    [Sam:]
          What's the meaning of this!

                    [Merry:]
          Sam, hold this...

Merry gives Sam a large cabbage.

                    [Sam:]
              (accusing)
          You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

A large pitchfork can be seen racing towards them along the
Hedgerow...angry shouts from Farmer Maggot.

                    FARMER MAGGOT    (O.S.)
          Who's that in my field!     Get out of it!
          Get out of my field, you    young varmits!
          I'll show you...get out    of my corn.

Merry and Pippin hurriedly gather their booty and race
away...with Frodo and Sam on their heels.

                    [Merry:]
              (looking behind him)
          I don't know why he's so upset, it's only
          a couple of carrots.

                    [Pippin:]
          And some cabbages...and those three bags
          of potatoes that we lifted last week.
          And then the mushrooms the week before.

                    [Merry:]
          Yes, Pippin, my point is, he's clearly
          over reacting.

The BAYING OF LARGE DOGS sounds!

EXT. WOODED ROAD -- DAY

Frodo, Sam, and Merry and Pippin tumble head over heels down
a bank, onto a dark, wooded road. CLOSE ON: A winded Pippin,
his face inches away from a large pile of Horse droppings...

                    [Pippin:]
          That was close.

Frodo picks himself up and looks around quickly.

                    [Merry:]
              (groaning)
          Ow...I think I've broken something.

Pulls a LARGE CARROT, almost broken through in the middle,
out from his back pocket.

                    [Merry:] (CONT'D)
          Oh.

          Trust a Brandybuck and a Took.

                    [Merry:]
          What? That was just a detour...a
          shortcut.

                    [Sam:]
          A shortcut to what?

Pippin has spied something under the trees on the far side of
the road.

                     [Pippin:]
              (excited)
          Mushrooms!

CLOSE ON: SMALL, brown mushrooms growing amongst the Loamy
undergrowth. Sam, Merry, and Pippin race toward the
mushrooms! Frodo is tense and watchful. He realizes they are
on a wooded road. Scattered leaves rise into the air Whirling
down the road as if blown by an invisible wind...

                                                             41.



SUDDENLY... THE SOUND OF HORSES HOOVES...

                      [Frodo:]
            I think we should get off the road.

A long drawn WAIL comes down the wind, like the cry of some
evil and lonely creature.

                      [Frodo:] (CONT'D)
                (more urgency)
            Get off the road!

Sam grabs Merry and Pippin as the Hobbits quickly scramble
down the bank, hiding under a mossy log. THE SOUND OF HOOVES
is close... A sinister MOUNTED RINGWRATH steps into
view...hooded and faceless, mounted on a huge snarling black
horse with insane eyes ! Frodo freezes in terror. The
RINGWRAITH pauses right beside their hiding place...he sits
very still with his head bowed, listening. From inside the
hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an
elusive scent; his head turning from side to side.

CLOSE ON: FRODO

Beads of sweat gather on his brow. The ringwraith suddenly
slides off his horse, leaning over the mossy log, peering
suspiciously into the woods.

CLOSE ON: FRODO

He is drawing the ring out of his pocket, with trembling
hands...his face fevered and sweating as if in the grip of
some terrible INTERNAL STRUGGLE. The SOUND OF SNIFFING
intensifies as the ringwraith darts his head from side to
side like a bird of party.

CLOSE ON: FRODO SQUEEZING HIS EYES SHUT...

QUICK PSYCHIC BLASTS!   AND EVIL DARK TOWER...A GREAT EYE...A

BURST OF FLAME.

ANGLE ON:   SAM LOOKING AT FRODO WITH CONCERN

                      [Sam:]
            Frodo?

Merry desperately hurls the mushrooms across the road...the
ringwraith spins around at the sound, and darts to the far
side of the road with frightening speed. Frodo instantly
slumps...as if a PSYCHIC LINK had been broken

Frodo is staring, a look of shock on his face at the ring
lying in the palm of his hand.

EXT. FERRY LANE -- NIGHT

Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin hurry through the
trees...slipping and sliding on the muddy ground.

                      [Sam:]
          Anything?

                      [Frodo:]
          Nothing.

          What is going on?

Merry moves past pippin, toward Frodo, watching
intently...Sam keeps looking around nervously.

                    [Merry:]
          The Black rider was looking for
          something...or someone...Frodo?

          Get down!

The SILHOUETTE OF A BLACK RIDER looms against the skyline.
The Four Hobbits... sprawled on the ground, holding their
breath. The BLACK RIDER turns and departs.

                    [Frodo:]
          I have to leave the Shire...Sam and I
          must get to Bree.

Merry looks at his friend...realizing Frodo is in deep
trouble.

The Hobbits break cover. SUDDENLY, A RINGWRAITH bursts out of
the forest TOWARD THEM!

QUICK ANGLES: STOMPING HOOVES...SNARLING HORSES...

Four RINGWRAITHS are speeding through the Fog...converging on
the FERRY CROSSING. The HOBBITS stampede across the Wharf and
Tumble onto the Ferry.

Frodo races across the Wooden Wharf, followed by the
ringwraiths. He leaps into the Ferry.

CLOSE ON: HOOVES THUNDER DOWN THE WOODEN WHARF!

Sam and Merry shove off with the poles...the ferry slides out
into the river, just as the ringwraiths arrive. They pull up
on the end of the wharf... shrieking with rage! The Hobbits
cover their ears. The Ringwraiths wheel their horses towards
the north and Gallop away along the river bank, quickly
disappearing into the fog.

                    [Frodo:]
          Sam, he'll be here.    He'll come.

Merry ploinks himself down at a table, carrying a very large
mug of beer.

                    [Pippin:]
          What's that?

                    [Merry:]
          This, my friend, is a pint.

                    [Pippin:]
          It comes in pints?    I'm getting one!

Sam watches Pippin rise unsteadily to his feet and head to
the bar.

                    [Sam:]
          You've had a whole half already. Merry
          watches Pippin go.

A COUPLE OF SWARTHY MEN leaning against the bar glance at
Frodo, then quickly look away.

                    [Sam:] (CONT'D)
              (tense)
          That fellow's done nothing but stare at
          you since we've arrived.

Sam indicates a BROODING STRANGER who sits alone at a table
in the far corner, smoking a curiously carved long stemmed
pipe, peering from beneath a travel stained cowl with
gleaming eyes. Frodo gestures to Butterbur...

                    [Frodo:]
          Excuse me, that man in the corner, who is
          he?

                    BUTTERBUR
          He's one of them Rangers; they're
          dangerous folk they are, wandering the
          wilds. What his right name is, I never
          heard, but round here he's known as
          Strider.

                    [Frodo:]
              (to himself)
          Strider.

BENEATH TABLE: FRODO'S fingers are nervously TOYING WITH THE
RING.

                                                            47.



CLOSE ON: FRODO

Sweat runs down his brow.   The Strange hum of the Ring spills
into the Soundtrack.

"Baggins...Baggins..." a creepy whisper seems to fill Frodo's
head...sound that dissolves into Pippin's loud voice:

                    [Pippin:]
          Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins...he's
          over there...

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN

sitting at the bar, chatting with Locals.   Frodo leaps to his
feet and pushes his way towards the bar.

                    [Pippin:]
              (loudly)
          Frodo Baggins. He's my second cousin
          once removed, on his mother's side and my
          third cousin twice removed on his
          father's side...if you follow me.

Frodo grabs Pippin's sleeve, spilling his beer.

                    [Frodo:]
          Pippin!

                    [Pippin:]
          Steady on, Frodo!

Pippin pushes Frodo away...he stumbles backwards, and falls
to the floor. At that instant, the Inn goes silent and all
the attention turns to Frodo...

                                                      CLOSE ON:

The ring...in agonizing Slow motion we watch as it seems to
hang in the air for a split second...then crashes down onto
his out stretched finger. FRODO VANISHES! There is a sharp
intake of breath...followed by total silence.

                                                        CUT TO:

EXT. BREE COUNTRYSIDE -- NIGHT

The RINGWRAITHS turn sharply in their saddles...Instantly
aware that the ring is being worn. They spur their horses
towards the distant lights of Bree.

INT. "PRANCING PONY" INN -- NIGHT

Sam looks sick; Pippin instantly sobers, realizing his folly;
the brooding stranger frowns...and the inn erupts into
excited babble.

                                        IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD:

                                                      ANGLE ON:

FRODO: as he finds himself in the TWILIGHT WORLD of the ring:
THE EXCITED CROWD ARE suddenly moving in slow
motion...distorted voices...a weird photographic negative
quality. FRODO is moving in real time; against the slow
motion background. He suddenly clutches his head as he is
hit with quick images...of a GREAT EYE! AN EVIL CAT-LIKE
EYE, wreathed in flames.

VOICE OF SAURON

There is no life here in the void...only cold...only death...
FRODO is terrified! He rolls under a table, desperately
pulling the ring from his finger. FRODO MATERIALIZES into the
real world. AT THAT MOMENT: A LARGE HAND reaches under the
table and Grabs Frodo by the collar, and DRAGS HIM AWAY!

Frodo is roughly pushed against the wall.    The Brooding
stranger looms over him.

Frodo is pushed into the Hobbit's room by Strider.

                    [Frodo:]
          What do you want?

                    [Aragorn:]
          A little more caution from you...that is
          no trinket you carry.

                    [Frodo:]
          I carry nothing.

                    [Aragorn:]
          Indeed? I can usually avoid being seen
          if I wish, but to disappear entirely...
          that is a rare gift.

                    [Frodo:]
          Who are you?

                    [Aragorn:]
          Are you frightened?

                    [Frodo:]
          Yes.

                    [Aragorn:]
          Not nearly frightened enough. I know
          what hunts you. Frodo jumps at the sound
          of a noise in the corridor. Strider
          deftly draws his sword.

The door bursts open and Sam, Merry and Pippin appear on the
doorway. Sam is Squaring off with is fists, Merry brandishes
a candlestick, and Pippin a chair.

                    [Sam:]
              (angry)
          Let him go or I'll have you, Longshanks!

ARAGORN SHEATHS his sword, a slight smile playing on his
lips.

                    [Aragorn:]
          You have a stout heart, little Hobbit,
          but that alone won't save you...You can
          no longer wait for the Wizard, Frodo.
          They're coming.

The gate keeper comes out of his Lodgings with a lantern...a
look of fear on his face. He approaches the closed gate with
great apprehension. CLOSE ON: The Gatekeeper peers out of his
Peephole.

CRASH!!

The gate crashed down on the gatekeeper...as four RINGWRAITHS
ride into Bree!

WIDE ON: the door creaks open...THE FOUR RINGWRAITHS silently
slide into the Hobbit's room. The LOOM above each bed,

QUICK INSERT: Sam's eyes open wide. In unison, the RINGWRAITS
STAB THE HOBBITS, in a Slashing, hacking frenzy.

INT. ARAGORN'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Strider is grimly listening to the sounds from his room.

INT. HOBBIT'S ROOM, PRANCING PONY -- NIGHT

Wide on: the RINGWRAITHS step back from the slashed beds in
triumph. CLOSE ON: a hacked blanket is pulled back to reveal
nothing but a shredded pillow. The RINGWRAITHS SHRIEK WITH
RAGE!! INSERTS: Sam sits up with a start! Close on: Another
shredded pillow is revealed! More Shrieks of rage. INSERT:
PIPPIN AND MERRY wake with a start.

INT. ARAGORN'S ROOM -- NIGHT

WIDE ON: Sam, Merry, and Pippin have been sleeping on
Strider's bed. Frodo stands next to Strider by the window,
peering out nervously as furious Ringwraith screeches echo
across the courtyard from the Hobbits room.

                    [Frodo:]
          Where are they?

                    [Aragorn:]

          Great Kings of men. Then Sauron the
          deceiver gave to them Nine Rings of
          Power. Blinded by their greed they took
          them without question, one by one falling
          into darkness and now they are slaves to
          his will.

Strider looks from the window as the Ringwraiths gallop down
the Bree Streets. CLOSE ON: Strider turns back to the
Hobbits, his face lit faintly by the Glowing Embers of the
Fire.

                    [Aragorn:] (CONT'D)
          They are the Nazgul, Ringwraiths, neither
          living or dead. At all times they feel
          the presence of the ring...drawn to the
          power of the one..they will never stop
          hunting you.

ARAGORN, MERRY, PIPPIN, AND FRODO march through a gloomy,
overgrown forest. Sam follows at the read leading "Bill", a
scrawny pony, who is laden with supplies.

          Where are you taking us?

                    [Aragorn:]

Frodo watches uneasily as Strider moves off into the cover of
the trees...

          You've already had it.

                    [Pippin:]
          We've had one, yes...but what about
          Second Breakfast?

Strider stares at Pippin blankly, then turns away, shaking
his head.

                    [Merry:]
          I don't think he knows about second
          breakfast, Pip.

on all sides by a sheer 500 FOOT DROP. Another whispering
wail rends the air. Gandalf crosses quickly to the edge and

Horror as ORCS hack into the trunk with axes.

                    [Pippin:]
          Oh, that's nice...ash on my tomatoes!

A SUDDEN SHREIK!

                                                       ANGLE ON:

FIVE RINGWRAITHS ON FOOT, running up the steep slope
unnaturally fast.

                    [Frodo:]
          Go! !

Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin clamber desperately towards the
summit, clutching their swords.

                                                         CUT TO:

EXT. WEATHERTOP SUMMIT -- NIGHT

Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin race into a RING OF BROKEN
STONES on the summit or Weathertop...the ruined base of an
ancient tower. The hobbits stand back-to-back in the centre
of the Ring, waiting for the first assault... One by one, the
5 Ringwraiths appear...brandishing Gleaming swords, they move
slowly towards the hobbits. In the center is their
leader...the WITCH KING!

                    [Sam:]
          Back, you devils!

Sam rushes forward with a cry. He swings his sword at the
Witch King, who blocks the blow with his own sword. Sam's
blade shatters...the WITCH KING lashes out with his fist,
sending Sam flying. Merry and Pippin, overcome with terror,
throw themselves flat on the ground. THE RINGWRAITHS close in
on Frodo...a Venomous whisper dances in his head...

Frodo shuts his eyes and staggers back, desperately resisting
the WRAITH'S WHISPERINGS... slow motion as his hand goes into
his pocket and pulls out the ring. The 5 Ringwraiths utter a
chilling SCREECH OF EXCITEMENT. Frodo is unable to resist any
longer, falls to his knees and slips on the ring. He
disappears.

                                                     ANGLE ON:

Frodo finds himself in the weird twilight world...he looks
upon the Ringwraiths, now visible in their TRUE APPEARANCE:
Five Ghouls dressed in long Grey robes, with white hair, and
Pallid, ruthless faces. THE WITCH KING extends a haggard hand
towards Frodo, reaching for the ring on his finger. Frodo's
trembling hand extends forward as if by the pull of the
ring...he slides to the ground, unable to pull his hand away.
The witch king snarls and springs forward. He stabs at Frodo
with a wicked dagger! Frodo winces as the tip of the dagger
sinks into his shoulder. Suddenly, Strider charges at the
RINGWRAITHS, wielding his sword in one hand, a flaming torch
in the other. He moves in slow motion, visible through a sea
of mist. Frodo sinks to the ground. Behind him is a faint
image of a Ringwraith fleeing, his head engulfed in flames.
With draining strength, Frodo manages to pull the ring off
his finger...

                                           IN THE REAL WORLD:

...Appearing back in the real world, Sam rushes over to him.

                    [Sam:] (CONT'D)
              (horrified)
          Frodo!

Another Ringwraith is burning and screaming...others screech
fearfully at the flames, turn and flee form the Weathertop
summit.

                    [Sam:] (CONT'D)
              (panicked)
          Mr. Frodo!!

Strider kneels before Frodo. He snatches up the Witch King's
Dagger from the ground, staring gravely at the long, thin,
blade.

                    [Sam:] (CONT'D)
          Help him, Strider!

                     [Aragorn:]
              (grim)
          He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade. The
          Morgul Blade suddenly melts...vanishing
          into the air like smoke. Strider throws
          the hilt down in disgust...

          This is beyond my skill to heal.
              (urgently)
          He needs Elvish medicine. Strider lifts
          Frodo onto his shoulders.

EXT. WEATHERHILLS -- NIGHT

Strider is jogging grimly, carrying an ailing Frodo on his
back. Sam, Merry, and Pippin are running to keep up. The
hobbits are carrying Flaming torches for protection.

                    [Aragorn:]
          Hurry!

                    [Sam:]
          We are six days from Rivendell. Frodo
          groans.

          Hold on, Frodo.

                     [Sam:]
          He'll never make it! Close on:

EXT. ISENGARD -- NIGHT

Low angle...looking up at ORTHANC...the tower of Isengard,
gleaming in the moonlight. The camera rises to reveal the
once beautiful gardens are not a pitted wasteland...with
smoke and fire billowing out

of numerous tunnels and vent holes that litter the forecourt
of ORTHANC. Strange guttural chants echo up from deep
underground. The camera is rising...a small moth flutters
into shot...and leads the camera towards the summit or
Orthanc. Gandalf lies slumped against the wall at the very
top of Orthanc, surrounded by a sheer 500 foot drop. He
looks Weak and Frail...and is seemingly asleep. The MOTH
flutters close to Gandalf. His hand suddenly moves at
lighting speed and SNATCHES THE MOTH. Gandalf brings his hand
close to his face and opens it. The moth sits on the palm of
his hand as Gandalf mutter strange words in a foreign tongue.
Close on: THE MOTH'S face... seemingly listening.

It suddenly flutters away. CAMERA FOLLOWS the moth off the
Orthanc summit, but drops past the moth...falling down, down,
towards the pitted wasteland, straight into a fiery red
tunnel!

INT. CAVERNS BELOW ISENGARD -- NIGHT

The dead trees of Isengard are fed into roaring
furnaces...molten metal pours into casts...red hot metal,
beaten my sweating orc blacksmiths...armor and weapons are
forged from the great furnaces. Saruman strides among the
ORCS and stands looking on a new born uruk-hai as it escapes
its birthing membrane...this is LURTZ, who rises up to stand
before his master.

rimmed...his brow, beaded with sweat.

                    [Pippin:]
          Is he going to die? Frodo's breathing is
          getting shallow. Strider looks out into
          the darkness.

                    [Aragorn:]
          No. He is passing into the shadow world,
          he will soon become a wraith like them.

A DISTANT CRY of a RINGWRAITH carries through the air.

Sam and Strider desperately search the dark forest floor for
the Athelas plant. Close on: A small, white flowered plant!
Strider drops to one knee, carefully pulling it from the
ground.

SUDDENLY!    ARAGORN FREEZES AS A SWORD BLADE TOUCHES HIS NECK.

                      [Arwen:] (O.S.)

Strider slowly looks up.

horse reaches the other side...Arwen pulls up and turns to
defiantly face the Ringwraiths from across the Ford.

flooding down the river towards the ford...as if a dam had
burst! The Foaming water seems to form the shape of Dancing

softly puffing on his pipe.    He smiles at Frodo.

                    [Gandalf:]
          Yes, I'm here and you're lucky to be
          here, too. A few more hours and you
          would have been beyond our aid. You have
          some strength in you, my dear Hobbit.

Frodo sits up, looking at Gandalf questioningly...

                    [Frodo:]
          What happened, Gandalf?    Why didn't you
          meet us?

                    [Gandalf:]
          I'm sorry Frodo.

Close on: Gandalf... troubled.   His eyes drift away.

                    [Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
          I was delayed.

[Saruman:] stands over Gandalf, gloating...

                    [Saruman:]
          Get up! So much for the power of the
          Ring or embrace your own destruction!

With the power of his staff, Saruman raises Gandalf from the
ground, then sends him crashing to the floor.

                    [Gandalf:]
          There is only one Lord of the Ring. Only
          one who can bend it to his will...and he
          does not share power.

SUDDENLY! GANDALF lurches to his feet and Throws himself off
the Tower! Saruman watches Gandalf fly away from
Isengard...on the Back of a GIANT EAGLE.

                    [Saruman:]
              (chilling)
          So you have chosen death!

Gwaihir the Eagle soars majestically over the mountains,

Frodo raises himself up and looks at Gandalf.

                    [Frodo:]
          Gandalf! What is it? Gandalf returns his
          attention to Frodo.

                    [Gandalf:]
          Nothing, Frodo...

Sam runs to Frodo's bedside.   He is overjoyed to find Frodo
awake.

                     [Sam:]
          Frodo!   Frodo!   Bless you, you're awake!!

                    [Gandalf:]
          Sam has hardly left your side.

                    [Sam:]
          We were worried about you--weren't we,
          Mr. Gandalf?

                    [Gandalf:]
          By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're
          beginning to mend. [Elrond:], LORD OF THE
          HIGH ELVES, steps up to Frodo's

bedside...his face is neither old nor young, though in it is
written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful.

                    [Elrond:]
          Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.
          Frodo sits up, looking at Elrond with
          awe.

          You have found your way to the last

          of Imladris have dwelt within this valley
          for three thousand years through few of
          my kin now remain. Frodo looks out from
          his balcony.

Frodo and Sam walk together. Suddenly, the voices of Merry
and Pippin can be heard as they bound up to Frodo and throw
their arms around him.

                     [Merry:]
          Frodo!   Frodo!

Sam looks past Frodo smiling... a bent figure sits alone on a
bench, in the Sun. Close on: Frodo turning, following Sam's
gaze...

Close on: BILBO BAGGINS! He breaks in to a broad grin as
Frodo rushes forward to embrace him. Bilbo has aged
significantly since we last saw him.

                    [Bilbo:]
          Hello, Frodo, my lad!

                     [Frodo:]
          Bilbo!

LATER... Frodo is turning the neatly inscribed title page of
a red leather bound journal:

                    [Frodo:] (CONT'D)
              (reading)
          "There and back again: A Hobbit's tale"
          by Bilbo Baggins.

Bilbo smiles Proudly. He is sitting with Frodo on a terrace
overlooking a Waterfall. Frodo looks at Page after page of
beautiful Handwriting, with intricate Maps and Drawings.

          This is wonderful.

                    [Bilbo:]
          I meant to go back...wander the paths of
          Mirkwood, visit Laketown, see the Lonely
          Mountain again...but age, it seems, has
          finally caught up with me.

Frodo turns a page...there before him, is a map of the Shire.

                    [Frodo:]
              (quietly)
          I miss the Shire...I spent all my
          childhood pretending I was off somewhere
          else...off with you, on one of your
          adventures...
              (Looks at Bilbo)
          But my own adventure, turned out to be
          quite different...I'm not like you,
          Bilbo.

Sam busily tries to stuff more and more things into his
already full pack...pots and pans, blankets, cooking
utensils, provisions, clothes.

                    [Sam:]
          No, what have I forgotten? Pull back to
          reveal Frodo, hands in his pocket,
          watching Sam.

                    [Frodo:]
          Packed already?

Sam looks up, startled.

                    [Sam:]
              (slightly embarrassed)
          No harm in being prepared. Frodo strolls
          to the edge of the Balcony.

          More than anything.

                    [Sam:]
          I did. It's just...we did what Gandalf
          wanted, didn't we? We got the Ring this
          far, to Rivendell...and I thought...
          seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be
          off soon. Off home.

                    [Frodo:]
          You're right, Sam. Frodo looks at Sam...

                    [Frodo:] (CONT'D)
          ...we did what we set out to do. Frodo
          opens his hand, the Ring sits in his
          Palm.

                    [Frodo:] (CONT'D)

          His strength returns.

                    [Gandalf:]
          That wound will never fully heal. He will
          carry it the rest of his life.

                    [Elrond:]
          And yet to have come so far still bearing
          the Ring...the hobbit has shown
          extraordinary resilience to its evil.

                    [Gandalf:]
          It is a burden he should never have to
          had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo.

                    [Elrond:]
          Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's
          forces are massing in the east. His eye
          is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you
          tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of
          allies grows thin.

          His treachery runs deeper than you know.
          By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc
          with Goblin Men...he is breeding an army
          in the caverns of Isengard. An army that
          can move in Sunlight and cover great
          distance at speed. Saruman is coming for
          the Ring.

Elrond turns and walks away...

                    [Elrond:]
          This evil cannot be concealed by the

          Isengard...Gandalf...the ring cannot stay
          here.

Gandalf turns and looks out the window.

Sounds of arrivals...Gandalf watches as Boromir rides through
Rivendell gate, followed by Legolas and Gimli.

          This peril belongs to all Middle earth.
          They must decide how to end it. Not just
          for themselves but for those who come
          after. Elrond approaches Gandalf.

                    [Elrond:] (CONT'D)
          The time of the Elves is over. My people
          are leaving these shores. Who will you
          look to when we have gone? The dwarves?
          They hide in their mountains seeking
          riches. They care nothing for the
          troubles of others.

                    [Gandalf:]
          It is in Men that we must place our hope.

                    [Elrond:]
          Men? Men are weak.      The race of Men is
          failing. The blood     of Numenor is all but
          spent, its pride and    dignity forgotten.
          It is because of men    the Ring survives.

Arwen reaches up and gently touches the Grey at Strider's
temples.

                    [Arwen:]
              (Elvish: with subtitles)
          Gwenin in enniath...u-arnech in naeth I
          se celich. Long years have passed...you
          did not have the care you carry now.

Arwen looks into Strider's eyes.

                    [Arwen:] (CONT'D)
              (Elvish: with subtitles)
          Renech I Beth I pennen? Do you remember
          what I told you? Arwen reaches for
          Strider's hand...

                    [Aragorn:]
              (quietly)
          You said you'd bind yourself to me,
          forsaking the immortal life of your
          people.


                                                  (CONTINUED)

                    [Arwen:]
              (whisper)
          And to that I hold. I would rather share
          one lifetime with you than face all the
          ages of this world alone. Strider looks
          down. In his hand lies the Evenstar.

                    [Arwen:] (CONT'D)
          I choose a mortal live.

                    [Aragorn:]
          You cannot give me this.

                    [Arwen:]
          It is mine to give to whom I will, like
          my heart.

Arwen closes Strider's fingers around the jewel.

Arwen leans towards Strider, gently kissing him.

                                                        CUT TO:

INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER, RIVENDELL -- DAY

Elrond addresses the council...

                    [Elrond:]
          Strangers from distant lands ... friends
          of old. You have been summoned here to
          answer the threat of Mordor. Middle-earth
          stands upon the brink of destruction.
          None can escape it. You will unite...or
          you will fall. Each race is bound to this
          fate...this one doom...

Frodo sits amongst a council of free-peoples of Middle earth,
Elrond stands before them, addressing Gandalf, Strider,
Legolas, and 20 other elves, Dwarves, and men.

                    [Elrond:] (CONT'D)
          Bring forth the ring, Frodo.

Frodo steps forward and moves towards a stone Plinth. He
places the ring on the plinth and returns to his seat.

                    [Boromir:]
              (shocked)
          So it is true!

                    [Legolas:]
              (disbelief)
          Sauron's Ring! The ring of power!

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            74.
CONTINUED:


                     [Gimli:]
              (grim)
          The doom of man!

                    [Boromir:]
          It is a gift...a gift to the foes of
          Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has
          my father, the Steward of Gondor, held
          the forces of Mordor at bay...by the
          blood of our people are your lands kept
          safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the
          enemy...let us use it against him!

                    [Aragorn:]
          You cannot wield it. None of us can.
          The one ring answers to Sauron alone...it
          has no other master. Boromir turns and
          looks at Strider, coolly.

                    [Boromir:]
          And what would a ranger know of this
          matter?

Strider says nothing and Boromir turns away dismissively.
LEGOLAS stands...

                    [Legolas:]
          This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn,
          son of Arathorn. You owe him your
          allegiance.

Frodo looks at Strider questioningly...Boromir turns sharply.

                    [Boromir:]
              (quiet disbelief)
          Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir?

                    [Legolas:]
          And heir to the throne of Gondor.

                    [Aragorn:]
              (Elvish: with subtitles)
          Havo dad, Legolas...Sit down, Legolas..

                    [Boromir:]
          Gondor needs no king.

                    [Gandalf:]
          Aragorn is right...we cannot use it.

                    [Elrond:]
          You have only one choice..the ring must
          be destroyed.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            75.

The HUM OF THE RING seems to grow louder in Frodo's ears.
Gimli suddenly stands, excited.

                    [Gimli:]
          Then...what are we waiting for?

Gimli suddenly rushes forward! He swings his axe down on the
ring. The axe shatters with a deafening crack! Gimli falls
backwards, staring in disbelief at the ring...unharmed! Frodo
winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him! He slumps
in this chair, clutching his forehead. Gandalf looks at him
with concern.

                    [Elrond:]
          The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son
          of Gloin, by any craft that we

                    [Elrond:] (CONT'D)
          here possess. The ring was made in the
          fires of Mount Doom...only there can it
          be unmade. It must be taken deep into
          Mordor, and cast back into the fiery
          chasm from whence it came. One of you
          must do this.

Stunned silence...the council sits with downcast eyes, as if
a great dread has descended on them. Boromir addresses the
council in a quiet voice

                    [Boromir:]
          One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its
          black gates are guarded by more than just
          Orcs. There is evil there that does not
          sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful.
          It is a barren wasteland, riddled with
          fire and ash and dust...the very air you
          breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with
          ten thousand men could you do this. It
          is folly.

                    [Legolas:]
          Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has
          said? The ring must be destroyed.

                    [Gimli:]
          And I suppose you think you're the one to
          do it?

                    [Boromir:]
          And if we fail, what then? What happens
          when Sauron takes back what is his?

Gimli leaps to his feet!

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                    [Gimli:]
          I will be dead before I see the Ring in
          the hands of an Elf! A STORM OF ARGUMENT
          erupts around the room. CLOSE ON:
          FRODO...sound disappears as he watches in
          slow

motion...the angry faces, the shaking fists, the accusatory
fingers, his eyes move across to the ring...the hum grows
louder in his head.

                    [Gimli:] (CONT'D)
              (shouting)
          Never trust an Elf!

CLOSE ON: THE RING fills the screen...streams of blood flow
across the surface... flames flicker within the Gold Band.

                    [Gandalf:]
          Do you not understand? While we    bicker
          among ourselves, Sauron's power   grows!
          No one will escape it. You will   all be
          destroyed, your homes burnt and   your
          families put to the sword!

CLOSE ON: FRODO...breathing rapidly, Caught in the grip of
his hideous vision. With a huge effort or will, Frodo tears
his gaze upon the ring. Frodo suddenly stands...he speaks in
a strong, clear voice.

                    [Frodo:]
          I will take it...I will take it...I will
          take the Ring to Mordor.

Sudden silence...Frodo looks around the room at the astounded
faces.

                    [Frodo:] (CONT'D)
              (quietly)
          Though...I do not know the way. Gandalf
          rises to his feet.

                    [Gandalf:]
          I will help you bear this burden, Frodo
          Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.

                    [Aragorn:]
          If, by my life or death, I can protect
          you, I will.
              (kneels before Frodo)
          ...you have my sword. Aragorn steps
          forward...followed by Legolas and Gimli.

          And my axe.

Boromir looks at them all then walks towards Frodo.

                    [Boromir:]
          You carry the fate of us all, little one.

Boromir looks towards Elrond and Gandalf.

                    [Boromir:] (CONT'D)
          If this is indeed the will of the
          Council, then Gondor will see it done.

Frodo stares in wonder as the Greatest Fighters in all Middle
earth stand at his side.

                    [Sam:]
              (unseen)
          Here!

A Sudden Noise...Sam pops up from behind a Bush!

                    [Sam:] (CONT'D)
          Mr. Frodo's not gong anywhere without me.

                    [Elrond:]
          No, Indeed...it is hardly possible to
          separate you...even when he is summoned
          to a secret council and you are not.

Merry and Pippin jump up from behind another bush!

                    [Merry:]
          Oi! We're coming too! You'll have to
          send us home tied up in a sack to stop
          us.

                    [Pippin:]
          Anyway...you need people of intelligence
          on this sort of
          mission...quest...thing...

                    [Merry:]
          Well, that rules you out, Pip.

                                                             78.



ELROND SURVEYS THE GROUP

                    [Elrond:]
              (thoughtfully)
          Nine companions ... so be it.
              (announcing)
          You shall be the "Fellowship of the ring"

                     [Pippin:]
          Great.   Where are we going?

INT. FRODO'S BEDROOM, RIVERDELL---DAWN

Close on: An old sword sliding out of a shabby leather
Scabbard...its polished, well tendered Blade glitters cold
and bright.

                    [Bilbo:]
          My old sword "Sting"...here, take it!

Bilbo offers Sting to Frodo.

                    [Frodo:]
          It's so light!

                    [Bilbo:]
          Yes, yes, made by the Elves, you know.
          The blade glows blue when Orcs are
          close...and it's times like that, my lad,
          when you have to be extra careful.

Bilbo unwraps a small shirt of close woven Mail.

                    [Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
          Here's a pretty thing. Mithril, as light
          as a feather, and as hard as dragon
          scales. Let me see you put it on. Come
          on.

CLOSE ON: Frodo peels off his shirt... revealing The Ring on
the Chain around his neck.

                    [Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
              (entranced)
          Oh! My old Ring... Frodo frowns as Bilbo
          moves toward him.

                    [Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
          I should very much like to hold it again,
          one last time. Bilbo reaches forward,
          eyes locked on the ring.

CONTINUED:


Suddenly! A shadow passes across Bilbo...for a split second
he becomes a wrinkled creature with a hungry face and Bony,
groping hands. Frodo pulls away, shocked...the shadow passes.
Bilbo slumps into a chair, his head in his hands. Bilbo
falters...his eyes filling with tears.

                    [Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
          Oh!

                    [Bilbo:] (CONT'D)
              (sad)
          I'm sorry, that I brought this upon you,
          my boy...I'm sorry that you must carry
          this burden. I'm sorry for everything.

Bilbo sobs and Frodo moves to comfort him.

turbulent waters...the misty mountains rise sharply to their
left.

                    [Gandalf:] (V.O.)
          We must hold to his course west of the
          misty Mountains for forty days. If our
          luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still
          be open to us. From there, our road
          turns east, to Mordor.

          Should not be too hard...

CLOSE ON: GIMLI has managed to corner Gandalf....

                    [Gimli:]
          If anyone were to ask for my opinion,
          which I note they have not, I would say
          we are taking the long way round.
          Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines of
          Moria. My cousin, Balin, would give us a
          royal welcome. Gandalf clearly thinks
          that is a bad idea.

                    [Gandalf:]
          No, Gimli. I would not take the road
          through Moria unless I had no other
          choice.

Boromir thrusts, catching Pippin on the hand. Pippin throws
down his sword, kicks and lunges at Boromir, tackling him to
the ground. Much laughter. Legolas' eyes are fixed on a
distant Dark Patch which darts about the sky, like flying
smoke in the wind.

                    [Sam:]
          What is that?

                    [Gimli:]
          Nothing...it's just a wisp of a cloud.

                    [Boromir:]
              (worried)
          It's moving fast...against the wind.

          Merry..Pippin...Sam...take cover! WIDE
          ON: THE FELLOWSHIP scramble under what
          little cover

there is...as a regiment of Large crows fly low overhead at
Great speed, wheeling and circling above. As their dark
shadow passes over the fellowship, a single harsh croak is
heard...and the crows suddenly wheel away, back towards the
south. Gandalf staggers to his feet.

                    [Gandalf:]
              (worried)
          Spies of Saruman.    The passage South is
          being watched.

Gandalf looks at Aragorn, turns to the others...gesturing
towards a high mountain pass.

                    [Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
          We must take the pass of Caradhras!

The Fellowship clamber through Rock and Snow. CLOSE ON: Frodo
slips on some shale...as he scrambles to his feet, the Ring
falls on the ground... CLOSE ON: the ring gleaming in the
snow! Boromir's Hand picks it up by the chain...he stands,
the ring dangling before his eyes. He seems to grow in
stature, as if absorbing its power. Aragorn warily approaches
Boromir...Boromir is motionless...he stares at the ring, as
if transfixed.

                     [Aragorn:]
          Boromir?

                    [Boromir:]
          It is a strange fate that we should
          suffer so much fear and doubt over so
          small a thing...such a little thing.

                    [Aragorn:]
              (quietly)
          Boromir...give the ring to Frodo.
          ARAGORN'S HAND moves to his sword hilt.

Ring's POV...looking up at Boromir's face. The strange hum
vibrates on the soundtrack. CLOSE ON: a Weird beatific smile
lights up Boromir's face...The HUM grows to a Deafening roar!
Boromir suddenly snaps out of his trance and hands the ring
back to Frodo.

                    [Boromir:]
              (lightly)
          As you wish. I care not.

Boromir smiles at Frodo, ruffling his hair. CLOSE ON: ARAGON
unhands his sword.

Following the crows as they race deeper and deeper, passing a

Birthsacks...flying past Saruman, who stands upon a wooden
Gantry. CLOSE ON: Saruman, listening to the Cries of the
crows.

                    [Saruman:]
          So, Gandalf...you try to lead them over
          Caradhras. And if that fails...where
          then will you go? THE FELLOWSHIP
          struggles through the snow.

                    [Saruman:] (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          If the mountain defeats you, will you
          risk a more dangerous road?

EXT. PASS OF CARADHRAS -- DAY

THE FELLOWSHIP are struggling through a blinding blizzard, up
towards the PASS OF CARADHRAS. Legolas the Elf moves lightly
across the top of the snow...he suddenly pauses. Saruman's
voice sweeps by in the wind.

                    [Legolas:]
              (urgent)
          There is a fell voice in the air.

          It's Saruman.

THUNDER RUMBLES...ROCK and Shale fall from above.

          No!

GANDALF RAISES HIS STAFF...HE CHANTS INTO THE WIND.

              (YELLING)
          Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho I

CAMERA SWEEPS PAST SARUMAN...he stands on the summit of
Orthanc, Chanting. CLOUDS ARE FLOWING FROM ALL DIRECTIONS...
converging on the distant mountains in a stormy Malestrom.

EXT. PASS OF CARADHRAS -- DAY

Saruman's voice strengthens...rolling past the fellowship
like thunder. A LIGHTNING CRACK explodes on the mountainside
above them. Frodo looks up in horror as a huge snow avalanche
thunders down towards them! The Fellowship throw themselves
against the cliff face as snow crashes onto the narrow ledge.
LEGOLAS pulls Gandalf to safety. Aragorn shields Frodo and
Sam as snow piles around them. Within moments, the pass is
blocked and the fellowship are enveloped in snow. Boromir
and Aragorn frantically dig for the hobbits...who are pulled
out Shivering and Fearful.

                    [Boromir:]
              (urgent)
          We must get off the mountain! Make for
          the gap of Rohan and take the West road
          to my city.

                    [Aragorn:]
          The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to
          Isengard.

                    [Gimli:]
          We cannot pass over the mountain. Let us
          go under it. Let us go through the mines
          of Moria. Gandalf has a concerned look on
          his face.

          Moria. You fear to go into those mines,
          don't you? The dwarves delved too
          greedily and too deep.

                    [Saruman:] (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          You know what they awoke in, the darkness
          of Khazad-dum. Shadow and flame.

                    [Gandalf:]
          Let the ringbearer decide.

CLOSE ON: FRODO, the weight of the decision weighing heavily
upon him. CLOSE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN shivering in Boromir's
arms.

                      [Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
          Frodo?

Frodo meets Gandalf's eye.

                    [Frodo:]
          We will go through the mines. Gandalf
          slowly nods.

The Fellowship are walking along the far shore of dark
lake...directly below great looming cliffs.

              (in awe)
          The walls of Moria!

Footing is treacherous on the narrow strip of green and
greasy stones. Gandalf touches the smooth rock wall between
the trees... slowly, faint lines appear like slender veins of
luminous silver running through the stone.

                     [Gandalf:]
          Itidin...it mirrors only starlight and
          moonlight.

A large moon rises over the mountains... The lines grow
Broader and Clearer, forming a glowing arch of interlacing
ancient letters and symbols.

          What do you suppose that means?

                    [Gandalf:]
              (confident)
          It's quite simple. If you are a friend,
          speak the password and the doors will
          open.

Gandalf raises his arms...

GANDALF CONTINUES...

Mumbling spells in his efforts to open the door. Sam packs
pots and pans at his feet...watching sadly as Aragorn un-
saddles Bill the pony. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN whispering to Bill
the Pony.

                    [Aragorn:]
              (whispering)
          Mines are no place for a Pony, even one

          Go on, Bill, go on..don't worry, Sam...he
          knows his way home. Aragorn slaps Bill on
          the rump...Bill goes trotting off. CLOSE
          ON: Sam watching Bill disappear into the
          darkness.

                    [Sam:]
          Goodbye, Bill.

SPLASH! Merry and Pippin are tossing stones into the lake.
Black Rippling rings slowly fan out. Pippin is about to
throw another stone, but Aragorn grabs his arm.

          Do not disturb the water.

Aragorn watches anxiously as the Ripples appear to grow....he
exchanges a look with Boromir.

Aragorn's hand creeps towards his sword. Gandalf gives up in
despair...he sits down beside Frodo. Close on: Frodo peers at
the Elvish inscription...his face breaks into a smile of
comprehension.

                    [Frodo:]
              (quietly)
          It's a riddle...

Gandalf raises his eyebrows...

                    [Frodo:] (CONT'D)
              (explaining)
          Speak, friend, and enter.   What's the
          Elvish for friend?

                    [Gandalf:]
          Oh...mellon.

With that, the rock face silently divides in the middle and
two great Doors swing outwards... revealing a blackness
deeper than the night. As the Fellowship enter the Blackness,
something in the water stirs....

INT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

The Fellowship step warily into the darkness of Moria...a
Dank cavern, with winding steps leading deeper into the
mountain.

                    [Gimli:]
          So, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled
          hospitality of the dwarves; roaring
          fires, malt beer, red meat off the bone.
          This, my friend, is the home of my
          cousin, Balin...and they call this a
          Mine...
              (snorting)
          A mine!

A Glow from Gandalf's Staff suddenly lights    the chamber...
The Fellowship recoil in Horror! Many dwarf    Skeletons are
strewn about, clearly the dead of some old    battle...the
rusting armor and shields are peppered with    arrows and axes.

              (in horror)
          Oh...no...no..no... ! Legolas pulls a
          crude arrow out of a skeleton.

                     [Legolas:]
          Goblins!

The Fellowship draw swords and back away, towards the
Entrance.

                    [Boromir:]
          We make for the Gap of Rohan.    We should
          never have come here.

EXT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

Frodo is suddenly PULLED TO THE GROUND. A long sinuous
Tentacle is wrapped around Frodo's ankle and is dragging him
towards the lake. FRODO CRIES OUT as Aragorn and Boromir rush
forward! Aragorn severs the Tentacle holding Frodo, and pulls
him to safety...Boromir hacks at the other Writhing Limbs. 20
more tentacles ripple out of the Lake! The dark water Boils
as the hideous beast lashes out at the FELLOWSHIP! Again the
creature grabs Frodo and pulls him to the lake, Frodo is
flung in the air as the Fellowship battle the creature.
Aragorn hacks at a tentacle...Frodo is released, falling into
Boromir's arms.

                    [Gandalf:]
          Into the mines!

                     [Boromir:]
          Legolas!

Legolas shoots an Arrow into the creature's head, gaining a
few vital seconds for Aragorn and Boromir as they race out of
the water with Frodo. The FELLOWSHIP hurriedly back away from
the Creature... retreating into the Moria Chamber as many
Coiling arms seize the large doors.

INT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

With a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away,
creating a rock slide that crashes down the Cliff Face.
Within seconds, tons of rock seal the doorway... throwing the
Fellowship into Pitch Blackness.

          We now have but one choice...we must face
          the long dark of Moria. Be on your

deep mine workings.

          the other side. Let us hope that our
          presence will go unnoticed.

INT. MORIA CEMETERY CAVERN -- NIGHT

They continue up a steep stair, passing through a dwarf
cemetery. The graves are despoiled...dwarf skeletons are
strewn about and Goblin Graffiti is scrawled on monuments in
dried Dwarf blood. The Atmosphere is very sinister.

The path splits into three passages...each disappearing into
dark tunnels. Gandalf pauses, frowning.

          I have no memory of this place.

LATER... The Fellowship are nervously waiting...while Gandalf
sits, staring intently at the 3 tunnel mouths in front of
him. He appears to be in some kind of trance.

He turns at the sound of a faint noise down the tunnel behind
them.

Frodo's POV: a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the
darkness. Frodo is nervous...he approaches Gandalf.

              (disbelieving)
          He escaped the dungeons of Barad- dur?

                    [Gandalf:]
          Escaped...or was set loose. And now the
          Ring has drawn him here...he will never
          be rid of his need for it. He hates and
          loves the ring, as he hates and loves
          himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story.
          Gandalf catches Frodo's look of surprise.

                    [Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
          Yes...Smeagol he was once called...Before
          the ring came to him, before it drove him
          mad.

Gollum's withered fingers are gripping the cave wall...he is
large, Luminous eyes blinking with malice.

                    [Frodo:]
             (grim)
         It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he
         had the chance.

                   [Gandalf:]
         Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's
         hand. Many that live deserve death, and
         some that die deserve life. Can you give
         it to them, Frodo? Frodo frowns.

                   [Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
         Do not be too eager to deal out death in
         judgment...even the very wise cannot see
         all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum
         has some part to play yet, for good or
         ill, before this is over. The pity of
         Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

                   [Frodo:]
         I wish the ring had never come to me...I
         wish none of this had happened.

                   [Gandalf:]
         So do all who live to see such times, but
         that is not for them to decide. All we
         have to decide is what to do with the
         time that is given to us. There is a note
         of finality in Gandalf's voice.

                   [Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
         There are other forces at work in this
         world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.
         Bilbo was meant to find the ring. In
         which case, you also were meant to have
         it...and that is an encouraging thought,
             (sudden brightness)
         Ah! That it's that way! Gandalf points
         at the right hand tunnel...the Fellowship
         scramble to their feet.

                   [Merry:]
             (relieved)
         He's remembered!

                   [Gandalf:]
         No, but the air doesn't smell so foul
         down there. If in doubt, Meriadoc,
         always follow your nose!
             (laughs)
         Yes...

                                                               91.



INT. DWAROWDELF CHAMBER, MORIA -- DAY

The Fellowship pass under an arched doorway into a black and
empty space. Gandalf pauses...

                    [Galadriel:]
          Let me risk a little more light. Gandalf
          taps his staff...for a brief moment a
          light

blazes... like a silent Flash of Lightning.    Great shadows
spring up and flee...

                    [Gandalf:]
          Behold! The great realm and Dwarf city
          of Dwarrowdelf! Frodo gasps at the brief
          sight of a vast roof, far above

their heads, upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone.
Before them stretches a huge empty hall, with black walls,
polished and smooth as glass.

                    [Sam:]
          Well, there's an eye opener and no
          mistake!

Ahead of them, a wooden door has been smashed. Black arrows
are embedded in the timbers. Two goblin skeletons lie in the
doorway. Gimli rushes ahead...

                    [Gandalf:]
          Gimli!!

                                                        CUT TO:

INT. BALIN'S TOMB, MORIA -- DAY

Gimli rushes into another vast empty chamber... lit with a
narrow shaft of sunlight, beaming in from a small hole near
the roof. Dwarf and Goblin skeletons are piled high. In the
far corner sits a stone walled Well. A shaft of light falls
directly onto a stone table in the middle of the room: a
single oblong block, about 4 feet high, topped with a great
slab of white stone. Gimli falls to his knees...

                    [Gimli:]
          No...no...oh, no!

Gimli sobs.

Gandalf quietly reads an inscription of runes, carved onto
the white stone slab.


                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             92.
CONTINUED:


                      [Gandalf:]
            "Here lies Balin, son of Fudin, Lord of
            Moria." He is dead, then. It's as I had
            feared.

Gandalf carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from
the white stone slab. It has been slashed and stabbed...and
appears to be covered in Dried Blood. The pages crack and
break as he opens it...

                      [Legolas:]
                (urgent whisper to Argorn)
            We must move on, we cannot linger.

                      [Gandalf:]
                (reading)
            "They have taken the Bridge and the
            second hall: we have barred the
            gates...but cannot hold them for
            long...the ground shakes...drums in the
            deep...we cannot get out. A shadow moves
            in the dark. Will no- one save us? They
            are coming."

Unnerved, Pippin backs away nervously...He stumbles against
the well, sending a precariously balanced Armored skeleton
tumbling in! Merry reaches out, Grabbing hold of Pippin
before he falls. The Fellowship freeze in stunned silence as
the armored skeleton clatters down the deep well...echoing
loudly!

INT. MORIA CAVERNS -- DAY

Gandalf turns angrily on Pippin.

                      [Gandalf:]
                (angry)
            Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next
            time and rid us of your stupidity!

ANGLE ON:    PIPPIN, CHASTENED.

They fall silent. A low rolling boom rises from the depths
below...growing louder...BOOM...BOOM...as if the caverns of
Moria were turned into a vast drum. A great horn blasts
nearby...Answering horns ... running feet...harsh cries...
Sam's eyes glance at Frodo's belt...

                       [Sam:]
                (worried)
            Mr. Frodo!

CONTINUED:


Frodo looks down. A cold blue glow is emanating from Sting's
Scabbard! Frodo draws the Sword...and stares at its glowing
blade!

                     [Legolas:]
          Orcs !

                    [Aragorn:]
              (to the hobbits)
          Get back! Stay close to Gandalf.

Aragorn and Boromir slam and wedge the doors. Boromir
catches sight of something; he turns to Aragorn with shock in
his eyes.

                    [Boromir:]
          They have a cave troll!

Gimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the
tomb.

                    [Gimli:]
              (yelling)
          Let them come! There is one Dwarf yet in
          Moria who still draws breath!

BOOM! The Door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments,
and 20 Goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave
troll! Gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his Axes in
2 Goblin helmets. Aragorn and Boromir wade into the mass of
Goblins with their swords. Legolas fires deadly arrows into
Goblin throats, desperately trying to Shield the Hobbits!
Gandalf is clutching his sword and joins in the battle! The
cave troll is sweeping his club at Aragorn...who stumbles
backwards...the huge club descends for the killing
blow...suddenly, in a flash of steel, Boromir's long sword
slices into the Scaly arm of the troll; it rears back,
spewing green blood! Sam is backing up against a wall...a
sword in one hand, a saucepan in the other. In desperation
he swings wildly at a Goblin with a saucepan! It keels
over...Sam looks surprised. He wallops another Goblin and it
too, drops.

                    [Sam:]
          I think I'm getting the hang of this.

The Cave Troll lunges forward, thrusting at Frodo's chest
with his spear.

                     [Frodo:]
          Aragorn!   Aragorn!

Sam screams as Frodo is lifted off his feet by the spear tip
and slammed against the wall.

                    [Aragorn:]
              (shocked yell)
          Frodo!!

The hobbits go crazy. Sam slashes at the cave troll's knee,
bringing him down...Merry and Pippin jump on him...Legolas
fires an arrow...and the cave troll topples, dead. Aragorn
rushes to Frodo's side as he slumps to the floor...Frodo
appears to be dead. Close on: Gandalf, Aragorn, Hobbits
looking horrified... Suddenly Frodo coughs...takes a huge
breath.

                    [Sam:]
          He's alive!

                    [Frodo:]
          I'm alright. I'm not hurt.

                    [Aragorn:]
          You should be dead. That spear would've
          skewered a wild boar!

                    [Gandalf:]
          I think there's more to this hobbit than
          meets the eye.

Frodo open his shirt to reveal the Mithril Vest.   The Troll
Spear did not pierce the mithril."

                    [Gimli:]
          Mithril! You are full of surprises,
          Master Baggins.

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM     the sound of the drums rings out again!
Gandalf turns to the others.

                    [Gandalf:]
          To the bridge of Khazad-dum!

They hurry towards a distant door...as Goblins start
scuttling down the Pillars behind them, like cockroaches!
Frodo looks with horror at the overwhelming Goblin army
that's rushing toward them! SUDDENLY! A deafening roar fills
the air! A fiery light dances down the hallway... the
pillars casting eerie shadows. The Goblins freeze. They back
Fearfully away from the approaching beast...melting into the
darkness.

                    [Boromir:]
          What is this new devilry?

A HUGE SHADOW, surrounded by flame, falls across the
hall..the ground shakes...an unearthly sound rumbles...

                    [Gandalf:]
              (quietly)
          A Balrog..a demon of the ancient world!
          This foe is beyond any of you!
              (urgent yell)
          Run! Quickly!

INT. STAIRWAY OF KHASAD-DUM, MORIA -- DAY

The BALROG, a massive creature rises from a chasm, a great
40 foot man-beast, with a mane of flames! In one hand is a
blade...like a stabbing tongue of fire; in the other, a WHIP
of many thongs. Aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a
dizzying stairway...Gandalf follows, leaning heavily on his
staff. Close on: Aragorn looks at Gandalf, concerned.

                    [Gandalf:]
          Lead them on, Aragorn.   The bridge is
          near.

Aragorn hesitates...Gandalf looks at him.

                    [Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
          Do as I say; swords are no more use here.

THE FELLOWSHIP race down the stairway, Aragorn picks up
Frodo..leaping across a gaping chasm. A NARROW BRIDGE,
spanning a bottomless pit...Gandalf yells to the others:
Aragorn makes to throw Gimli across the Chasm.

                    [Gimli:]
          Nobody tosses a dwarf! The BALROG smashes
          through the wall and spreads its vast
          wings.

              (yelling)
          Over the bridge! Fly!

They race towards the slender bridge of stone...without kerb
or rail...at the far end of the hall. The Fellowship
recklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge..but Gandalf... the
last..pauses in the middle of the span...he faces the
Balrog...staff in one hand...Sword in the other! Frodo looks
back in horror:

                    [Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
          You cannot pass!

          I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
          wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark
          fire will not avail you, flame of Udun.

Frodo watches as the Balrog puts one foot on the bridge and
draws up to Full Height, wings spreading from wall-to-wall.
Gandalf is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow
bridge.

                    [Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
          Go back to the shadow! The BALROG slashes
          at Gandalf with its Sword of

flame...Gandalf blocks with his sword...a ringing clash and
the Balrog's sword shatters into molten fragments!

                    [Gandalf:] (CONT'D)
              (booming)
          You shall not pass!! The Balrog places

GANDALF CRIES ALOUD as he summons up his LAST RESERVES OF

He thumps the bridge with his staff...a blinding sheet of
white flame springs up... the staff shatters...the bridge
breaks... right at Balrog's feet. The stone bridge drops away
into the gulf...from under the Balrog. For a moment, the
great Beast remains poised in the air...then it plunges down:
in slow motion Relief floods Frodo's face..Gandalf remains
trembling on the lip of the broken bridge. Slow motion: As
the Balrog falls, he lashes out with his whip of fire... Slow
motion: The thongs of the whip lash and curl around Gandalf's
knees, dragging him over the brink! Gandalf just manages to
hand on by his fingertips

EXT. EDGE OF LOTHLORIEN--DUSK

WIDE ON: The fellowship run across a forest floor strewn with
yellow flowers..above is a roof of golden leaves, held up by
silver pillars...the trunks of huge, grey trees. Gimli looks
nervously around...

          Stay close, young hobbits..they say a

                    [Galadriel:] (V.O.)
          ...your coming to us is as the footsteps
          of doom. You bring great evil here,
          Ringbearer.

                       [Sam:]
          Mr. Frodo?

                    [Gimli:]
          Well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare
          so easily. I have the eyes of a hawk and
          the ears of a fox!

The FELLOWSHIP are suddenly surrounded by ARMED ELVES.
Deadly arrows aimed at their heads. HALDIR, the Elvish
captain steps forward... he looks at Gimli with disdain.

                    HALDIR
          The dwarf breathes so loud we could have
          shot him in the dark.

                    [Aragorn:]
              (Elvish: with subtitles)
          Haldir of Lorien, we come here for your
          help. We need your protection.

                    [Gimli:]
          Aragorn! These woods are perilous. We
          should go back.

                    HALDIR
          You have entered the realm of the Lady of
          the Wood. You cannot go back.

Haldir's eyes lock onto Frodo.

                    HALDIR (CONT'D)
          Come, she is waiting.

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. LOTHLORIEN HILLTOP -- DAY

Haldir leads the Fellowship onto a Hill Top.   They look with
wonderment at the vista spread before them.

Several miles towards the South, a Large Hill rises out of
the woods. Upon the hill rise many mighty Mallorn Trees,
taller than any others...Nestled high in the crown of the
mallorns is a Beautiful City. It Gleams in the low rays of
the late afternoon sun..green, gold, and silver. To the east
of Caras Galadhon, the Woods of Lorien run down the pale
gleam of Anduin, the great river. Beyond the River, the land
appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away,
it rises again like a dark and dreary wall. The Sun that lies
on Lothlorien has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie
beyond.

                                                       CUT TO:

ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP

step onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light. The walls
are green and silver, the roof gold and in its midst is the
trunk of the might Mallorn tree, now tapering toward its
crown. Celeborn steps forward to greet the guests. His hair
is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no
sign of age upon it. Next to him stands Galadriel, the Lady
of the Elves. She has hair of deep gold and timeless,
unsurpassed beauty. Celeborn looks hard at Aragorn...

                    CELEBORN
          Eight there are, yet nine there were set
          out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is
          Gandalf, for I much desire to speak with
          him.

Frodo looks at Galadriel, standing silently beside Celeborn.

                    [Galadriel:] (V.O.)
              (softly aloud)
          ...he has fallen into shadow. Galadriel
          looks to Aragorn.

                    [Galadriel:] (CONT'D)
          The Quest stands upon the edge of a
          knife. Stray but a little and it will
          fail, to the ruin of all...Yet hope
          remains while the company is true.

Galadriel's eyes settle on Sam.

                    [Galadriel:] (CONT'D)
          Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go
          now and rest for you are weary with
          sorrow and much toil. Galadriel's eyes
          turn to Frodo...her voice fades.

                    [Galadriel:] (CONT'D)
          Tonight you will sleep in peace.
              (whispered v/o)
          Welcome, Frodo of the Shire... CLOSE ON:
          FRODO looks at GALADRIEL. SUDDEN INSERT:
          GALADRIEL as she is on the other

side... Powerful, divine...no longer of this world..a
Piercing white light surrounds her.

                    [Galadriel:] (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          ...one who has seen the eye.

EXT. CARAS GALADHON LAWN -- NIGHT

Gimli, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, Frodo and Sam are in a
pavilion set among the trees near the fountain. They lie on
soft couches as Elves leave food and wine for them. MOURNFUL
SINGING drifts down from the trees above.

                    [Legolas:]
              (sadly)
          A lament for Gandalf...

                    [Merry:]
          What do they say about him?

                    [Legolas:]
          I have not the heart to tell you. For me,
          the grief is still too near. Boromir is
          sitting alone...Aragorn approaches him.

                     [Aragorn:]
          Take some rest..these borders are well
          protected.

Moonlight catches the trace of tears on Boromir's face.
Aragorn kneels down beside him.

                    [Boromir:]
          I will find no rest here. I heard her
          voice inside my head...she spoke of my
          father and the fall of Gondor, and she
          said to me: "Even now, there

                    [Boromir:] (CONT'D)
          is hope left. But I cannot see it...it
          is long since we had any hope.

CLOSE ON: BOROMIR looks at ARAGORN in despair.

                    [Boromir:] (CONT'D)
          My father is a noble man, but his rule is
          failing and our..our people lose faith.
          He looks to me to make things right...and
          I would do it, I would see the glory of
          Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it,
          Aragorn? The White Tower of Ecthelion,
          glimmering like a spike of pearl and
          silver, its banners caught high in the
          morning breeze...have you ever been
          called home by the clear ringing of
          silver trumpets?

                    [Aragorn:]
          I have seen the white city..long ago.

CONTINUED:


Boromir feels Aragorn's love for Minas Tirith and takes
heart,

                      [Boromir:]
            One day our paths will lead us there, and
            the tower guards shall take up the call
             "the Lords of Gondor have returned."

Aragorn returns Boromir's smile...betraying his disquiet
sadness only when Boromir looks away.

                                                          CUT TO:

LATER....

The Fellowship are asleep on their beds. Gimli is snoring
loudly. CLOSE ON: BARE FEET tread soundlessly across the
lawn. CLOSE ON: Frodo's eyes flicker open...as if by
instinct. GALADRIEL, her White dress glowing in the
moonlight, glances at him. Frodo follows her...as if drawn by
an invisible force.

                                                          CUT TO:

EXT. GALADRIELS GLADE, LORTHLORIEN -- NIGHT

Upon a low stone pedestal, carved like a branching tree, sits
a shallow Silver Basin. Galadriel leads Frodo into the small
Glade.

                      [Galadriel:]
            Will you look into the mirror? Frodo
            looks with apprehension at the silver
            basin.

                      [Frodo:]
                (warily)
            What will I see?

Galadriel pours water into the basin from a silver jug...a
glow rises from the water.

                      [Galadriel:]
            Even the wisest cannot tell for the
            mirror shows many things...things that
            were ..things that are...and some things
            that have not yet come to pass.

Frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal...he peers     into the
glossy surface. The night sky is reflected into     the water...
suddenly a figure takes form...the bowed figure     of an old
man, clad in white robes. He walks down a long      road. Frodo
leans closer to the mirror's surface...

                                                          103.



CLOSE ON: GANDALF LIFTS HIS HEAD AND LOOKS DIRECTLY AT FRODO!

FRODO gasps, his face lighting up with hope.

                    [Frodo:]
              (joyous)
          Gandalf!

Gandalf looks at Frodo with a fierce intensity. Frodo
reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror.
Suddenly the image flares, burning out to white. The vision
shifts...Frodo gasps in horror! The Shire is in ruins! The
image suddenly widens to fill the screen...buildings
burning...bodies strewn about...Dark Shapes of ORCS looting
and destroying...Bag End, billowing in flames! The Party
tree is hacked down. Frodo reels back as the mirror seems to
grow...the nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing
him entirely.

IMAGE: Hobbiton...now an Industrial wasteland! The fields
and trees destroyed...replaced with Brick factories belching
smoke! IMAGE: ORCS brutally herd manacled Hobbits into the
Factories! We see Sam...Merry... and Rosie Cotton. Soot-
stained and sobbing, they disappear into the factory hell-
hole! Suddenly, the mirror goes dark...and out of the black
abyss a single eye grows. CLOSE ON: FRODO IS FROZEN. Unable
to move or cry out. The ring dangles from his neck, inches
above the water...not shimmering with curls of steam. Fire
erupts around the eye... With a Yell, Frodo pushes himself
away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground. Light
instantly fades from the mirror. Frodo comes to his
senses...he is shocked. Galadriel stands still as a statue,
unmoved, untouched by the horror.

                    [Galadriel:]
          I know what it is you saw...for it is
          also in my mind. It is the future,
          Frodo. It is what will come to pass if
          you should fail.

Galadriel looks at Frodo intensely...Frodo looks down...in
his hand he is clutching the ring. Frodo looks up at
Galadriel.

                    [Galadriel:] (CONT'D)
          The fellowship is breaking. It has
          already begun. He will try to take the
          ring. You know of whom I speak. One by
          one, it will destroy them all.

                    [Frodo:] (V.O.)
          If you ask it of me, I will give you the
          One Ring.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    [Galadriel:]
          You offer it to me freely...I do not deny
          that my heart has greatly desired this.

Galadriel suddenly seems to rise in stature before Frodo's
eyes. Frodo is suddenly afraid of her.

                    [Galadriel:] (CONT'D)
          In place of the Dark Lord, you would have
          a Queen, not dark, but beautiful and
          terrible as the Dawn. Treacherous as the
          Sea! Stronger than the foundations of
          the earth...all shall love me and
          despair! Frodo takes a step away from
          Galadriel...

Galadriel suddenly laughs...a slender Elf-woman once more,
clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad.

                    [Galadriel:] (CONT'D)
              (gently)
          I pass the test.
              (laughs)
          I will diminish and go into the west and
          remain Galadriel. Frodo's confidence
          drains away.

                    [Frodo:]
          I cannot do this alone...

                    [Galadriel:]
          You are the ring-bearer, Frodo...to bear
          a ring of power is to be alone. This task
          was appointed to you, and if you do not
          find a way, no one will.

Frodo realizes what her message is.

                    [Frodo:]
          Then I know what I must do. It's
          just...I'm afraid to do it. Galadriel
          kneels down to Frodo's height, staring at
          him intently.

                    [Galadriel:]
          Even the smallest person can change the
          course of the future.

The Ring lies in the palm of Frodo's hand...his fingers close
over it.

INT. ORTHANC CHAMBER -- DAY

Naked, Lurtz's eyes follow Saruman, alight with a mean
intelligence.

                    [Saruman:] (V.O.)
              (smiles)
          They were Elves once. Taken by the Dark
          Powers ... tortured and mutilated...a
          ruined and terrible form of life. And
          now...perfected. My fighting Uruk-Hai.
          Whom do you serve?

          Saruman.

INT. CAVERNS BELOW ISENGARD -- DAY

QUICK CUTS: LURTZ is quickly armored...Breastplate...Leg
guards, Helmet...a sword is thrust in Lurtz's hand. The URUK-
HAI are smearing themselves in white paint...a creepy
ritualistic ceremony...the white hand of Isengard is smeared
on bodies, faces, and armor. SARUMAN address a crowd of 200
fully armed URUK-HAI.

                    [Saruman:]
          Hunt them down. Do not stop until they
          are found. You do not know pain. You do
          not know fear. You will taste man-flesh.
          Saruman turns to Lurtz.

                    [Saruman:] (CONT'D)
              (coldly)
          One of the Halflings carries something of
          great value...bring him to me...alive and
          unspoiled...kill the others.

EXT. ISENGARD -- DAY

Lurtz is leading 200 URUK-HAI out of Isengard..they run fast,
their powerful legs carrying them at speed.

EXT. SILVERLODE RIVER BANK--DAWN

The Fellowship are in small elven boats. They row away from
the Lothlorien Shore into the Silverlode river. Elves
quietly watch them depart. Galadriel gives Frodo a small
Crystal Phial.

                    [Galadriel:]
          Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the
          light of Earendil, our most beloved star.

As the Fellowship's boats drift past, Galadriel stands alone,
watching from the banks of the river. In his head, Frodo
still hears her voice...

                    [Galadriel:] (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          May it be a light for you in dark places,
          when all other lights go out.

EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY

The boats pass into the great river Anduin. The Three Elven
boats carry the Fellowship steadily southward. Green trees
slowly give way to a brown and withered land.

EXT. FOREST -- DAY

The Uruk forces are running through the trees with deadly
purpose.

EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY

A flock of birds circle high above, Black against the pale
sky. Aragorn watches them with concern.

EXT. PILLARS OF THE KINGS, RIVER ANDUIN--DAWN

The Three Elven boats drift slowly through the steep rocky
gorge in the Pre-dawn light. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN, slowly
paddling in the stern.

              (quietly)
          Frodo.

Frodo slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement. Wide
on: Two enormous rock statues, towering like 300 foot
pinnacles on either side of the river...carved images of
Gondorian kings of old. They loom over the boats with power
and majesty.

                    [Aragorn:] (CONT'D)
          The Argonath...

Close on: Aragorn...strangely moved by the beauty of the
silent sentinels. He speaks, almost as if to himself.

                    [Aragorn:] (CONT'D)
              (deeply moved)
          Long have I desired to look upon the
          kings of old...my kin.

The fellowship stare in stunned silence as the current takes
them through the narrow gap between the Statues' feet.

Wide on: Craning up past the statues vast crumbling heads, to
reveal a large lake only a mile down river...

EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL -- DAY

ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP

As they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded
shore.

                    [Aragorn:]
          We cross the lake at nightfall, hide the
          boats and continue on foot..we approach
          Mordor from the North.

          Oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding
          our way through Emyn Muil, an impassable
          labyrinth of razor sharp rocks. And
          after that gets even better...a
          festering, stinking marshland, far as the
          eye can see.

                    [Aragorn:]
          That is our Road...I suggest you take
          some rest and recover your strength,
          Master Dwarf.

Legolas turns to Aragorn with urgency.

                    [Legolas:]
          We should leave now.

                    [Aragorn:]
          No. Orcs patrol the Eastern shore. We
          must wait for cover of darkness.

                    [Legolas:]
          It is not the Eastern shore that worries
          me.

Legolas casts a glance around into the Parth Galen forest...

                    [Legolas:] (CONT'D)
          A shadow and a threat has been growing in
          my mind. Something draws near, I can
          feel it.

CONTINUED:


Aragorn looks at Legolas, knowing full well what he means.
Sam has slumped asleep...Merry dumps a small pile of kindling
at Gimli's feet...

                    [Merry:]
          Where's Frodo?

Sam sits up with a start...Aragorn's head snaps round..his
eyes fly to Boromir's shield which lies abandoned by his camp
bed. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN.... as he realizes Boromir has gone!

EXT. SLOPES OF AMON HEN -- DAY

Frodo is walking beneath the trees...lost in thought. His
feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab...his eyes
follow an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the
summit of Amon Hen...the seeing seat. A CRACKLING SOUND!
Frodo freezes....

                    [Boromir:]
              (quietly)
          None of us should wander alone; you least
          of all. So much depends on you...Frodo?

Frodo turns slowly...he stares at Boromir, tense, cautious.

                    [Boromir:] (CONT'D)
          I know why you seek solitude. You
          suffer, I see it day by day. Are you
          sure you do not suffer needlessly?

Frodo stands silent for a moment..the murmur of the Wind in
the trees and the distant roar of the falls of Rauros can be
heard

                    [Boromir:] (CONT'D)
          Let me help you. There are other ways,
          Frodo..other paths that we might take.

                    [Frodo:]
          I know what you would say, and it would
          seem like wisdom but for the warning of
          my heart.

                     [Boromir:]
          Warning?   Against what?

Boromir has started forward towards Frodo, he pulls himself
up.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                         109.
CONTINUED:


                    [Boromir:] (CONT'D)
          We are all afraid, Frodo. But to let that
          fear drive us to destroy what hope we
          have...don't you see that is madness?

                    [Frodo:]
          There is no other way.

                    [Boromir:]
          I ask only for the strength to defend my
          people.
              (angrily drops the wood he has
               collected)
          If you would but lend me the ring...

                    [Frodo:]
          No. . .

Frodo steps hurriedly away from Boromir.

                    [Boromir:]
          Why do you recoil?   I am no thief.

                     [Frodo:]
              (wary)
          You are not yourself.

                    [Boromir:]
          What chance do you think you have? They
          will find you, they will take the ring
          and you will beg for death before the
          end.

Frodo turns to leave.

                    [Boromir:] (CONT'D)
          You fool! It is not yours save by
          unhappy chance...it might have been mine.
          It should be mine. Give it to me! Give
          me the ring.

Boromir leaps on top of Frodo, grasping for the ring! Frodo
has only moments to act. Frodo rips the ring from around his
neck..and rams it on his finger.

                    [Frodo:] DISAPPEARS
          Boromir spins wildly around, yelling into
          thin air!

                    [Boromir:]
          I see your mind...you will take the ring
          to Sauron. You will betray us! You go to
          your death and the death of us all.

            Curse you! Curse you and your Halflings!
            Boromir stumbles and falls. His body
            shakes as if in the Throes of a
            fit...slowly he comes to.

                      [Boromir:] (CONT'D)
                (Disoriented)
            Frodo! Frodo! What have I done. Please,
            Frodo...

EXT. SEEING SEAT -- DAY

                                          IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD:

FRODO races through the misty twilight world, past the foggy
shapes of twisted trees. Somewhere behind him, Boromir's
distraught voice carries from another dimension:

                      [Boromir:] (O.S.)
            I'm sorry, Frodo...Frodo...

Frodo suddenly finds himself on the stone steps...he clambers
up the stairs, onto a high seat, perched on four stone
pillars. Frodo cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the
throne of mountain kings. The world of mist swirls around
him. Frodo peers out from the seat...the world seems to
shrink. In all directions, Views of far off lands telescope
towards him through the mist. IMAGES: ORCS spilling out of
holes in the misty mountains... flames rising from
Mirkwood...grim faced easterlings march to war...black ships
sailing into the south. All the power of the Dark Lord is in
motion. Frodo moves his gaze towards the east...fire explodes
against the smoke, as a huge mass of black battlements fills
Frodo's vision. A mountain of iron, immeasurably strong,
tower of adamant: Barad-dur, FORTRESS OF SAURON!

SUDDENLY!   SAURON'S EYE LEAPS TOWARD FRODO LIKE A FINGER OF

LIGHT.

SAURON (V.O.)

(IN BLACK SPEECH)

They will fall! Frodo leaps off the seat, and tumbles down
the stairs! The eye sweeps Amon Hen like a searchlight,
seeking its ring! With a huge effort, Frodo wrenches the ring
off his finger...

EXT. SUMMIT OF AMON HEN -- DAY

Frodo lies gasping on the summit of Amon Hen...below the
ancient ruins of the seeing seat.

                                                            111.



AT THAT MOMENT: A BLACK BOOT STEPS INTO SHOT!

Frodo looks up as Aragorn towers over him.

                       [Aragorn:]
          Frodo?

                     [Frodo:]
              (numb)
          It has taken Boromir. ARAGORN moves
          towards Frodo...

                    [Aragorn:]
              (urgent)
          Where is the ring?

Frodo backs away from Aragorn...Aragorn is shocked by the
movement.

                       [Frodo:]
          Stay away!

                    [Aragorn:]
          Frodo...I swore to protect you.

                    [Frodo:]
          Can you protect me from yourself?

Frodo uncurls his fist...in is palm lies the ring! It
glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun...Aragorn's
eyes are drawn to it.

                    [Frodo:] (CONT'D)
          Would you destroy it?

                    [Aragorn:]
              (kneeling to Frodo)
          I would have gone with you to the end...
          into the very fires of Mordor.

                    [Frodo:]
          I know...Look after the others,
          especially Sam...he will not understand.

Aragorn freezes!   He draws his sword.

                     [Aragorn:]
              (urgent)
          Go, Frodo!

Frodo hesitates.

          Run! Run!!

Frodo backs away into the trees...as 200 URUK-HAI SWARM onto
Amon Hen behind Aragorn!

Aragorn attacks the leading URUK-HAI like a madman... he
brings two down with his sword...leaping into the ruins as
others close in on him. Frodo scrambles down the hillside,
away from the fight. Aragorn battles the URUK-HAI, amongst
the pillars and blocks of Amon Hen. Despite his bravery, he
is quickly surrounded... SUDDENLY: ELVEN ARROWS smash into
the URUK-HAI. Legolas races out of the woods, firing his bow.
Gimli leaps into the battle, wielding his might axe.

EXT. PARTH GALEN HILLSIDE -- DAY

Frodo is darting down the steep hillside as heave feet
thunder down behind him.

                       [Sam:]
          Mr. Frodo!

Sam looks around for Frodo. CLOSE ON: LURTZ ordering his
URUKS.

                     LURTZ
          Find the Halflings ... find the
          halflings!

Frodo stumbles and falls...quickly he crawls behind a
tree...above him the sound of Uruk-Hai crashing through the
forest rings out.

                    [Merry:] (O.S.)
              (urgent whisper)
          Frodo!

Frodo turns to see Merry and Pippin hidden in a hollow, a few
feet away.

                    [Merry:] (CONT'D)
          Hide here, quick!

                       [Pippin:]
          Come on...

Frodo looks at his friends... slowly shakes his head, a great
sadness in his eyes...

                    [Pippin:] (CONT'D)
          What's he doing?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

Merry's eyes meet Frodo's.        Understanding.

                    [Merry:]
              (softly)
          He's leaving.

                        [Pippin:]
          No!

Pippin stands and makes a move toward Frodo...Merry grabs at
his arm.

                        [Merry:]
          Pippin!

THE ECHO OF BOROMIR'S HORN reaches Aragorn, Legolas, and
Gimli...they are battling their way down the Slopes towards
the lake.

                    [Legolas:]
          The horn of Gondor!

                        [Aragorn:]
          Boromir!

Aragorn desperately slashes his way towards Boromir, felling
URUK-HAI in his path...while Legolas and Gimli fight a rear
guard action. MANY URUK-HAI fall to Boromir's sword as he
tries to protect Merry and Pippin...

                        [Boromir:]
          Run!   Run!

Lurtz takes aim. A black arrow suddenly thuds into Boromir's
chest. Amazingly, Boromir continues fighting, but another
arrow...and another, brings him to his knees. Merry and
Pippin are scooped off their feet by URUK-HAI.

                        [Merry:] & [Pippin:]
          Aaaaagh!      Boromir! Boromir!

Lurtz aims his bow at Boromir's heart... suddenly Aragorn
charges at him, smashing the Bow with his sword. They lock
into a deadly battle. Aragorn cuts Lurtz down and races
towards Boromir, who lies slumped against a tree...URUK-HAI
arrows sticking out of his chest. At least 20 dead URUK-HAI
lie heaped around Boromir. His horn lies at his feet...Cloven
in two.

                    [Boromir:]
              (painful gasp)
          They took the little ones...

          Aragorn quickly tries to staunch the flow
          of Blood from Boromir's shoulder.

                    [Boromir:] (CONT'D)
              (panicked)
          Frodo...where is Frodo?

                    [Aragorn:]
          I let Frodo go.

Boromir holds Aragorn's gaze.

                    [Boromir:]
          Then you did what I could not.   I tried
          to take the ring from him.

                    [Aragorn:]
          The ring is beyond our reach now.

                    [Boromir:]
          Forgive me, I did not see..I have failed
          you all.

                    [Aragorn:]
          No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You
          have kept your honor. Aragorn tries to
          bind Boromir's wound.

                    [Boromir:]
          Leave it! It is over...the world of Men
          will fall and all will come to darkness
          and my city to ruin..Aragorn..

                    [Aragorn:]
          I do not know what strength is in my
          blood, but I swear to you... I will not
          let the White City fall, nor your people
          fail...

                    [Boromir:]
          Our people...our people...

Aragorn places Boromir's sword in his hand.   Boromir's
fingers tighten around the hilt.

                    [Boromir:] (CONT'D)
          I would have followed you, my
          brother...my captain, my King. Aragorn
          lays Boromir down. He is dead.

                    [Aragorn:]
          Be at peace, son of Gondor. Aragorn bends
          and Kisses Boromir's forehead.

EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL -- DAY

On the lakeshore Frodo stands in front of one of the Elvish
Boats, the ring in his palm. A distraught Sam...running as
hard as he can through the forest...

                        [Sam:]
           Mr. Frodo!

Close on: Frodo looks to the far side of the river...the
camera moves in on the ring.

                     [Frodo:] (V.O.)
           I wish the ring had never come to me..I
           wish none of this had happened...

Tears fall down Frodo's face...

                     [Gandalf:] (V.O.)
           So do all who lie to see such times...but
           that is not for them to decide. All we
           have to decide is what to do with the
           time that is given us.

With renewed determination, Frodo tucks the ring inside his
vest pocket. The small figure of Frodo pushing the Elvish
boat into the water... Sam bursts through the trees and runs
toward the lake...Frodo is already paddling away.

                     [Sam:]
               (anguished)
           Not alone, Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo, in
           the boat, paddling steadfastly away from
           the

shore..tears in his eyes..the voice of Sam carried on the
wind. Frodo whispers to himself

                        [Frodo:]
           No, Sam.

Sam looks at the water...then at the boat.

SPLASH!   FRODO turns to see Sam launching himself into the
water.

Sam splashes hopelessly toward the boat.

                    [Sam:]
          Of course you are...and I'm coming with
          you!

                    [Frodo:]
          You can't swim.

Sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing...Frodo
drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat...

                       [Frodo:] (CONT'D)
                 (frightened)
          Sam!

Sam is underwater...hands flailing helplessly as he sinks.
Close on: Frodo's hand grasping Sam's... Frodo pulls a
bedraggled and half drowned Sam into the boat. Frodo and Sam
look at each other, out of breath, tears and water streaming
down both their faces.

                     [Sam:]
          I made a promise, Mr. Frodo...a promise.

          "Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."
              (sobs)
          And I don't mean to...I don't mean to.

                    [Frodo:]
              (crying)
          Oh, Sam!

Frodo starts to laugh through his tears...the two friends
hug.

                    [Frodo:] (CONT'D)
          Come on then..

The two Hobbits row through the water...

EXT. FALLS OF RAUROS AERIAL -- DAY

Slow motion: Looking down on swiftly flowing
water...Boromir's body slides under camera.

He is lying in one of the boats, his arms across his
chest..his broken horn at his side. Suddenly... the boat
drops away from camera...as it plunges over the massive falls
of Rauros, disappearing into the vapor below.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           117.
CONTINUED:


                    [Legolas:]
          If we are quick, we will catch Frodo and
          Sam before nightfall.

Aragorn looks towards the far shore; Frodo and Sam's small
Boat can be seen lying on the distant Riverbank as Frodo and
Sam make off into the forest beyond. He doesn't react.
Legolas turns and looks at Aragorn.

                    [Legolas:] (CONT'D)
          You mean not to follow them...

                    [Aragorn:]
          Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

                    [Gimli:]
          Then it has all been in vain...the
          fellowship has failed.

                    [Aragorn:]
          Not if we hold true to each other. We
          will not abandon Merry and Pippin to
          torment and death, not while we have
          strength left.

Aragorn pulls a HUNTING KNIFE out of his pack and straps it
on.

                    [Aragorn:] (CONT'D)
          Leave all that can be spared behind...
          CLOSE ON: ARAGORN..a steely light in his
          eye.

                    [Aragorn:] (CONT'D)
              (grimly)
          We travel light. Let's hunt some Orc.

                       [Gimli:]
          Yes!   Ha!

Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli disappear into the Woods,
following the URUK-HAI trail.

EXT. EMYN MUIL HILLTOP -- DAY

Frodo and Sam scramble onto a high ridge.

A distant line of Saw toothed mountains below a dark,
oppressive sky. Black volcanic smoke rises behind the
mountains....MORDOR!




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            118.
CONTINUED:


                     [Frodo:]
          Mordor!   I hope the others find a safer
          road.

                    [Sam:]
              (simply)
          Strider'll look after them.

                    [Frodo:]
          I don't suppose we'll ever see them
          again.

                    [Sam:]
          We may yet, Mr. Frodo.   We may.

                     [Frodo:]
          Sam?

Frodo looks at Sam with great affection..despite the grim
outlook, Sam is undeterred...

                    [Frodo:] (CONT'D)
          I'm glad you're with me.

                         [Camera pans over the Misty Mountains 
                         as voices drift in from the background.]

                                     [Gandalf:]
                         I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder 
                         of the Flame of Anor!
 
                         [Camera pans closer to the mountain 
                         side.]
 
                                     [Gandalf:]
                         Argh! Go back to the shadow. The Dark 
                         Fire will not avail you, Flame of Ud n! 
                         [Camera zooms in through the mountain 
                         and focuses on Gandalf and the Balrog 
                         on the bridge of Khazad-d m. The Balrog 
                         strikes down on Gandalf with its flaming 
                         sword. Gandalf parries the blow with 
                         Glamdring, shattering the Balrog s sword.] 
                         YOU  SHALL NOT... PASS!!!
 
                         [Gandalf strikes his staff onto the 
                         bridge. As the Balrog steps forward, 
                         the bridge collapses from under it and 
                         the demon plunges backward into the 
                         chasm. Gandalf, exhausted, leans on 
                         his staff and watches the Balrog fall 
                         then turns to follow the others. At 
                         the last minute, the flaming whip lashes 
                         up from the depths of the abyss and 
                         winds around Gandalf s ankle, dragging 
                         him over the edge. He clings onto the 
                         bridge but is straining to keep his 
                         grip.]
 
                                     [Gandalf:]
                         Argh!

                         [Frodo rushes forward but Boromir restrains 
                         him.]
 
                                     [Boromir:]
                         No! No!

                         Fly, you fools!

                         [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into 
                         the chasm]
 
                                     [Frodo:]
                         Noooooooooooooooo!!!!

                         [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into 
                         the chasm]
 
                                     [Frodo:]
                         [Calls after Gandalf as he falls into 
                         the abyss] Gaaandaaaaalf!!
 
                         [Gandalf falls after the Balrog and 
                         grabs hold of his sword Glamdring on 
                         his way down. As they continue to plunge 
                         into the depths, Gandalf hacks away 
                         at the Balrog even as it thrashes and 
                         bounces off the walls. They continue 
                         to plunge at great speed, sometimes 
                         with Gandalf clinging to the horn of 
                         the demon. The battling pair then falls 
                         into an enormous cavern and plunges 
                         into the water. Just then Frodo awakens 
                         as if from a nightmare.]
 
                                     [Frodo:]
                         Gandalf!

                                     [Sam:]
                         What is it, Mr. Frodo?

                                     [Frodo:]
                         Nothing. Just a dream. [Lies back down.]
 
                         
                         [Frodo and Sam climbs over the rocky 
                         terrain Emyn Muil. They look into the 
                         distance at the Mountain of Fire.]
 
                         
                                     [Sam:]
                         Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth 
                         we don t want to see any closer, and 
                         the one place we re trying to get to. 
                         It s just where we can t get. Let s 
                         face it, Mr. Frodo, we re lost. I don t 
                         think Gandalf meant for us to come this 
                         way.
 
                                     [Frodo:]
                         He didn t mean for a lot of things to 
                         happen, Sam... but they did.
 
                         [Suddenly Frodo feels and sees the Eye 
                         zooming in on him. He gasps and pants 
                         as he backs away.]
 
                                     [Sam:]
                         Mr. Frodo? It s the Ring, isn t it?
 
                         
                                     [Frodo:]
                         It s getting heavier. [Clutches the 
                         Ring by his chest and sits down, still 
                         panting. He then fumbles for his water 
                         bottle and takes a sip.]
 
                                     [Frodo:]
                         What food have we got left?

                                     [Sam:]
                         Well, let me see. [He takes out a package 
                         of lembas bread from his pack] Oh yes, 
                         lovely   Lembas bread. And look! [He 
                         digs deeper into his pack] More lembas 
                         bread.
 
                         [Sam shows another package. He then 
                         breaks off a piece and tosses it to 
                         Frodo, and munches on a piece himself.]
 
                         
                                     [Sam:]
                         I don't usually hold with foreign food, 
                         but this Elvish stuff, it s not bad.
 
                         
                                     [Frodo:]
                         [smiles] Nothing ever dampens your spirits, 
                         does it Sam?
 
                         [Sam smiles back, and then looks ominously 
                         towards Mordor.]
 
                                     [Sam:]
                         Those rain clouds might.

                         [They continue trekking through difficult 
                         terrain, often huddling underneath their 
                         cloaks.]
 
                                     [Sam:]
                         [Looks around] This looks strangely 
                         familiar.
 
                                     [Frodo:]
                         [Exasperated] It s because we ve been 
                         here before! We re going in circles.
 
                         
                                     [Sam:]
                         Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrant 
                         there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you 
                         smell it?
 
                                     [Frodo:]
                         Yes. I can smell it. [Drops to a whisper] 
                         We re not alone.
 
                                     [NIGHTTIME
                         Frodo and Sam are sleeping. A dark shape 
                         appears on top of the cliff. The creature 
                         Gollum has appeared and is making his 
                         way down to the hobbits.]
 
                                     [Gollum:]
                         The thieves! The thieves! The filthy 
                         little thieves! Where is it? Where isss 
                         it? They stole it from us. My preciousss. 
                         [Gollum creeps closer and closer.] Curse 
                         them! We hates them! It s ours, it is... 
                         and we wantssss it!
 
                         [Gollum reaches out his hand towards 
                         the hobbits. Suddenly the hobbits spring 
                         up, grab hold of Gollum s arms and pull 
                         him down. Amidst the struggle, Gollum 
                         wriggles loose and leaps onto Frodo. 
                         As Frodo falls back, the chain and Ring 
                         around his neck is revealed and Gollum 
                         jumps straight for the Ring. Sam tries 
                         to grab at him but is knocked away. 
                         Gollum now jumps on top of Frodo and 
                         tries to reach for the Ring even as 
                         Frodo grabs his hands and tries to push 
                         him away. Gollum s cheeks puff with 
                         exertion as he struggles with Frodo, 
                         his enormous eyes fixed on the Ring. 
                         Sam grabs hold of Gollum again and tears 
                         him away from Frodo. Gollum then turns 
                         around and bites Sam on the shoulder, 
                         wriggles around and clasps his arms 
                         around Sam s neck and legs around his 
                         waist in a death grip. Frodo unsheathes 
                         Sting and holds it to Gollum's throat.]
 
                         
                                     [Frodo:]
                         [menacingly] This is Sting. You've seen 
                         it before, haven t you... Gollum! Release 
                         him or I ll cut your throat!
 
                         [Slowly, Gollum loosens his grip on 
                         Sam and as the latter disentangles himself, 
                         Gollum wails. In the next scene, Gollum 
                         is being dragged with Sam's Elvish rope 
                         around his neck, wailing and writhing 
                         in pain.]
 
                                     [Gollum:]
                         It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty 
                         Elves twisted it. Take it off us!

                         Quiet you!

                         [Sam tugs fiercely at the rope. Gollum 
                         cries some more and collapses onto his 
                         back. Sam turns to Frodo in dismay.]
 
                         
                                     [Sam:]
                         It s hopeless! Every Orc in Mordor s 
                         going to hear this racket! Let s just 
                         tie him up and leave him.
 
                                     [Gollum:]
                         No! That would kill us! Kill us!

                                     [Sam:]

                         Maybe he does deserve to die, but now 
                         that I see him, I do pity him.
 
                                     [Gollum:]
                         [Begging] We be nice to them if they 
                         be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears

                                     [Frodo:]
                         There s no promise you can make that 
                         I can trust.

                         you to your word.

                         frightened, and climbs onto a boulder]

                         tries to get away from him. He crashes 
                         onto the ground, choking.]

                         can we do in the end? We've got the 
                         Shire. Maybe we should go home.

                         emerges in front of him. Frodo stares 
                         at the Nazgul, fixated. Feeling the

             And we wept, Precious, we wept to be so
             alone. And we forgot the taste of bread,
             the sound of trees, the softness of the
             wind . . . We even forgot our own name.
                  (in a choking cough)
             Gollum! Gollum!

towards the MOUNTAINS.

SETTLE ON: FRODO and SAM in a FILTHY CULVERT.
SAM twitches in a RESTLESS SLEEP. But FRODO is awake . . . His
hand trails down to the CHAIN around his NECK ...

A SUDDEN HISS! FRODO quickly hides the RING as GOLLUM peers
at them with GLEAMING EYES.

                        [Gollum:]
             Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies! We
             must go, yes, we must go at once!

SAM STIRS, looks at FRODO . . .

                        [Sam:]
             Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

FRODO shakes his HEAD.

SAM looks at the dead, BROWN TWILIGHT, below the LOWERING
CLOUD.

                        [Sam:] (cont'd)
             It must be getting late.

                        [Frodo:]
             No . . . no it isn't. It isn't midday yet.
             The days are growing darker.

The GROUND suddenly QUIVERS, as a ROLLING, RUMBLING NOISE
ECHOES down the VALLEY.

                        [Gollum:]
             Come on, must go, no time ...

                        [Sam:]
             Not before Mr. Frodo's had something to eat.

                        [Gollum:]
             . . . no time to lose, silly.

SAM shoots GOLLUM a HOSTILE LOOK and turns back to rummage in
his KNAPSACK. He holds up a piece of dried LEMBAS BREAD to
FRODO.

                        [Sam:]
             Here.

                        [Frodo:]
             What about you?

                        [Sam:]
                  (lying badly)
             I'm not hungry - leastways, not for lembas
             bread.

                        [Frodo:]
             Sam.

                        [Sam:]
                  (confessing)
             Alright. We don't have that much left.

            We have to be careful or we're going to run
            out. You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.
            I've rationed it. There should be enough.

FRODO looks at SAM questioningly.

                        [Frodo:]
            For what?

                       [Sam:]
            The journey home.

FRODO says nothing.                                            .

            Come, Hobbitses. Very close now. Very close

Far off, half veiled int he swirling STEAM, the TOWER of
ORTHANC stands ... Unbroken by the storm. Pale waters lap
about its feet.

ANGLE ON: TWO SMALL HOBBITS are sitting on the SMASHED WALL
. . . MERRY and PIPPIN! SPREAD before them is a feast of
BREADS, MEATS and WINE. They PUFF on long pipes as they lie
back in the SUN.

             We are sitting on a field of victory,

           We're under orders from Treebeard, who's
           taken over management of Isengard.

WIDE: GANDALF leads the company through the flotsam and
jetsam which floats upon the muddied waters surrounding the
TOWER ... TREEBEARD, the GIANT ENT, strides towards them,
ALARMING all but GANDALF.



                     [Treebeard:]
           Huraroom ... Young Master Gandalf, I'm glad
           you've come. Wood and water, stock and ,
           stone I can master, but there's a wizard to
           be managed here ... Locked in his tower.

                      [Gandalf:]
           And there Saruman must remain, under your
           guard, Treebeard.

                     [Gimli:]

           it.                            .

                (quietly)
           No. He has no power any more.

THE OLD ENT nods his head wisely . . .

                       [Treebeard:]
           The filth of Saruman is washing away ...
           Trees will come back to live here, young
           trees . . . wild trees.

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, his eye caught by something lying in the WATER

black stone ...

             Oh, you can search - up and down

                     [Aragorn:]
          We till have time.

GANDALF turns quickly to ARAGORN.

                    [Aragorn:] (cont'd)
          Every day Frpdo moves closer to Mordor.

GANDALF watches his friend's face . . . seeking reassurance.

                    [Gandalf:]
          Do we know that?

                     [Aragorn:]
               (gently)
          What does your heart tell you?

                     [Gandalf:]
               (with a small smile)
          That Frodo is alive.
               (to himself)
          Yes - yes, he is alive.

EXT. MORGUL VALLEY - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM lie asleep amidst scrubby bushes near a
stagnant pool. SMEAGOL lies nearby, muttering in his sleep.

                     [Smeagol:]
          Too risky, too risky. The thieves! They
          stole it from us. Kill them . . . kill them
          ... kill them both!

SMEAGOL wakes suddenly, shaking, his face drenched in SWEAT,
eyes wide in horror.

                     SME AGO L (c ont' d)
          No!

             Shhh! Quiet!

SMEAGOL'S features suddenly transform into the MALEVOLENT
face of GOLLUM!

                        [Gollum:] (cont'd)
             Mustn't wake them, mustn't ruin it now!

SMEAGOL casts a quick glance over his SHOULDER to the
SLEEPING figures of FRODO and SAM as he clambers off his ROCK
. . . silently sidling towards the EDGE of a STAGNANT POOL.

                        [Smeagol:]
             They knows, they knows, they suspects us.



SMEAGOL stares into the MURKY depths of the WATER.

The SURFACE RIPPLES as the face of GOLLUM appears as SMEAGOL'S
REFLECTION.

             No! Not! Never!! Smeagol hates nasty
             Hobbitses! Smeagol wants to see: them -
             dead!

           We must get the Precious. We must get it
           back.

                      [Gollum:]
           Patience, patience, my love. First we must
           lead them to her.

                      [Smeagol:]
           We lead them to the windy stairs.

                      [Gollum:]

           Yes, the stairs ... and then?

           She's always hungry, she always needs to
           feed. She must eat, all She gets is filthy
           Orcses.

                      [Smeagol:]

            He's a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol

SAM makes for SMEAGOL again . . . with a look of MURDEROUS
RAGE.

EXT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - EARLY DAWN

ARAGORN joins LEGOLAS on the STEPS to the GOLDEN HALL, oblivious
to the CHILL WIND . . . they look out across the SLEEPING CITY to
the LOOMING MOUNTAIN RANGE BEYOND . .-. DARK CLOUDS mark the sky.

                      [Legolas:]
           The stars are veiled, something stirs in
           the east . . . A sleepless malice.

LEGOLAS looks at ARAGORN . . . realisation in his face.

                      [Legolas:] (cont'd)
           The eye of the enemy is moving.

INT. EDORAS, SLEEPING QUARTERS - EARLY DAWN,

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN . . . he is AWAKE! He sits up . . . ANXIOUS,
FIDGETY . . .

Suddenly he hops out of bed and creeps towards the SLEEPING FORM
of GANDALF.

           What you doing?

PIPPIN gasps with FRIGHT! MERRY is sitting up, wiping sleep
from his eyes. He moves on . . .

ANGLE ON: A sleeping GANDALF lies with eyes wide open! But
PIPPIN is undeterred . . .

MERRY sits up, a worried look on his face.

                       [Merry:] (cont'd)
             Pippin? Pippin? Pippin! What are you doing?

With quick stealth, PIPPIN lifts the WRAPPED PALANTIR from
GANDALF'S grasp ...

                       [Merry:] (cont'd)
             Pippin, are you mad?

                        [Pippin:]
             I just want to look at it. Just one more
             time.

                       [Merry:]
             Put it back! Put - it - back!

PIPPIN unwraps the PALANTIR and as MERRY looks on HORRIFIED,
he gazes INTENTLY into it.

                       [Merry:] (cont'd)
             Pippin!

As PIPPIN lays his hands on the CRYSTAL, a SICKLY PALE light
slowly spreads from the GLASS BALL onto PIPPIN'S FACE ... his
EYES WIDEN.

INT. EDORAS, SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

PIPPIN suddenly starts to HYPERVENTILATE . . . He STAGGERS
BACKWARDS, PALANTIR held rigidly before him . . .

THE GREAT EYE OF SAURON seems to LEAP from the FIRE . . . PIPPIN
is bathed in the FIERY RED LIGHT.

PIPPIN sinks to his KNEES, his mouth open in a soundless SCREAM
. . . He FALLS BACKWARDS, powerless to release the FIERY GLOBE.

                        [Merry:]
             Help! Someone help him!

GANDALF wakes with a start! Just as ARAGORN enters, and
wrenches the PALANTIR from PIPPIN'S HANDS . . . PIPPIN FALLS to
the FLOOR! . . . ARAGORN spins away, reeling backwards, the
PALANTIR falling from his HANDS . . .

The PALANTIR rolls across the FLOOR, causing EVERYONE in the
room to COWER BACK.                                    ;


ANGLE ON: GANDALF throws a BLANKET over it, ANGRY DISBELIEF

INT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - DAY

THEODEN stands in the GOLDEN HALL, gravely listening to
GANDALF ... ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI look on . . .

                     [Gandalf:]
          There was no lie in Pippin's eyes; a fool,
          but an honest fool he remains. He told
          Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.

ANGLE ON: GIMLI lets out a sigh of relief.

GANDALF turns to look at THEODEN.

                        [Gandalf:] (cont'd)
             We've been strangely fortunate. What Pippin
             saw in the Palantir was a glimpse of our
             enemy's plan.

GANDALF looks from on to the other of the, gathered company.

                       [Gandalf:] (cont'd)
             Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas
             Tirith. His defeat at Helm's Deep showed
             our enemy one thing.

The WIZARD turns towards ARAGORN . . .

                        [Gandalf:] (cont'd)
             The heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are
             not as weak as he supposed. There is
             courage still - strength enough left to
             challenge him.

THEODEN listens intently, saying nothing.

MERRY thrusts a SMALL PACKAGE into PIPPIN'S HAND . . .

the GLEAMING TOWER.                                         '

             Lord Denethor, however, is not the King. He
             is a steward only. A caretaker of the
             throne.

GANDALF lowers his voice, as they approach the TOWER HALL.

                  (quietly)
             Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor is
             Boromir's father. To give him news of his
             beloved son's death would be most unwise
             ... And do not mention Frodo . . . Or the
             Ring . . . And say nothing of Aragorn either.
                  (hesitates)
             In fact, it's better if you don't speak at
             all, Pippin Took.

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, suitably chastened, nods.

INT. MINAS TIRITH TOWER HALL - DAY

ANGLE ON: A LONG SOLEMN HALL ... with ROWS OF BLACK MARBLE
PILLARS. Between the pillars stand a silent company of TALL
KINGS carved in cold STONE.

GANDALF strides down the HALL, with PIPPIN following
obediently behind.

At the FAR END, upon a DAIS OF MANY STEPS, sits a LARGE,
EMPTY THRONE . . . and on the wall behind is the IMAGE of a
FLOWERING WHITE TREE set in GEMS.

At the FOOT of the DAIS, in a small STONE CHAIR, sits an OLD
MAN, gazing at his lap: DENETHOR - the Lord Steward of
CONDOR.

                        [Gandalf:]
             Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and
             Steward of Gondor.

DENETHOR does not look up as GANDALF and PIPPIN approach.

                        [Gandalf:] (cont'd)
             I come with tidings in this dark hour - and
             with counsel.

DENETHOR slowly raises COLD EYES . . .

                         DENETHOR
                  (bitter)
             Perhaps you come to explain this?

             Boromir died to save us . . . my kinsman and
             me . . . he fell, defending us from many
             foes.

CLOSE ON: DENETHOR pain flickers in his eyes.

             I offer you my service, such as it is, in
             payment of this debt.

DENETHOR looks at PIPPIN blankly, overcome with grief.:

                         [Gandalf:]
                  (to PIPPIN)
             Get up!

             My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for
             Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming
             ... the Enemy is on your doorstep. As
             Steward, you are charged with the defence
             of this city. Where are Condor's armies?

DENETHOR gaze turns slowly on GANDALF . . .

            You still have friends - you are not alone
            in this fight. Send word to Theoden of
            Rohan. Light the beacons.

DENETHOR smiles at GANDALF, as if amused by something.

                        DENETHOR
                 (softly)
            You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for
            all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. Do
            you think the eyes of the White Tower are
            blind? I have seen more than you know. With
            your left hand you would use me as a shield
            against Mordor and with your right you
            would seek to supplant me.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF looks shocked, DENETHOR'S eyes NARROW.

                      DENETHOR (cont'd)
                (contemptuous)
           I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh,
           yes. Word has reached my ears of this
           Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you
           now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the
           North - last of a ragged house, long bereft
           of Lordship.

                       [Gandalf:]
                (stung)

            The rule of Condor is mine, and no others!

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, horrified. GANDALF looks at Denethor
closely for a moment, then turns on his heel to leave, PIPPIN
follows.

                      [Gandalf:]
            Come.

GANDALF and PIPPIN stride from the TOWER HALL ... DENETHOR
slumps back into his SEAT.

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN is carefully laying out a SMALL UNIFORM of
the ROYAL GUARD on a bed.

                     [Pippin:]
          So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial
          position . . . I mean, they don't actually
          expect me to do any fighting . . . do they?

GANDALF watches the young HOBBIT.



                     [Gandalf:]
          It's the deep breath before the plunge.

                      [Pippin:]
          I don't want to be in a battle . . . but
          waiting on the edge of one I can't escape

like a man unable to prevent a sure disaster.

             This will be the end of Gondor as we know

                        [Gandalf:] V/0
             This war is long planned. Sauron has hated
             the west through many ages . . . It is a
             hatred that flows from the depths of time,
             across the deeps of the Sea.

The WITCH KING SWOOPS down the VALLEY to join the HEAD of his
ARMY. He vanishes into the GLOOM - a shadow into shadow.

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM peers out from his stony hiding place.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF striding BACK STREETS of the CITY . . . so

                       [Gandalf:]
             Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task to
             be done. Another opportunity for one of the
             Shire-folk to prove their great worth!

GANDALF kneels down and looks at PIPPIN earnestly, his hand
on PIPPIN'S shoulder.

                       [Gandalf:] (cont'd)
             You must not fail me.

arrive HUNDREDS of ORCS race ashore. FARAMIR steps out, his

             You have given us hope.

PULL BACK: to reveal THEODEN stares around at the STREETS and
PEOPLE of EDORAS . . . it is as if he knows he will not see
this place again.

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM following GOLLUM up the dizzying
STAIRWAY, carved into the SHEER CLIFF.

The STEPS are NARROW, UNEVENLY SPACED, and many are BROKEN.

their desperate FINGERS clinging to the STEPS ABOVE - trying
not to look at the LONG BLACK FALL below them.

ANGLE ON: FRODO'S foot slips and for a brief moment he is
HANGING PRECARIOUSLY from the ROCK-FACE.

                      [Gollum:]

           Master carries heavy burden . . . Smeagol
           knows . . . Heavy, heavy burden. Fat one
           cannot know. Smeagol look after Master.

ear:

                  (rasping whisper)
           He   wants it - he needs it. Smeagol sees it
           in   his eye. Very soon he will ask you for
           it   - you will see . . . the Fat One will take
           it   from you.

             I will not yield the River and Pelennor

             Much must be risked in war. Is there a

AERIAL SHOT: . . . HIGH above MINAS MORGUL, on the SMALL LEDGE
next to the STAIRS, LIE the FIGURES of FRODO, SAM and GOLLUM.

SAM watches a sleeping GOLLUM suspiciously as he desperately
tries to stay awake. SLOWLY, INEVITABLY, SAM, falls asleep.

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM'S EYES SNAP OPEN . . . he sits up and quietly
crawls towards SAM'S KNAPSACK.

SAM breathes deeply now, heavily asleep.

GOLLUM grimaces in DISTASTE as he pulls out the LEMBAS BREAD

                        [Smeagol:]
                  (prevaricating)
             Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so
             polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that
             nobody else could find and they say
             "Sneak!", "Sneak!". Very nice friends, oh
             yes, my Precious, very nice.

                        [Sam:]
             Alright, alright - you just startled me is

                      [Pippin:]
                (uneasy)
           Well . . . yes, at least, well enough for my
           own people ... but we have no songs for
           great halls and evil times . . . we seldom
           sing of anything more terrible than wind or
           rain.

                      DENETHOR
           And why should your songs be unfit for my
           halls, or for hours such as these. Come -

                      [Pippin:] V/0
           Home is behind, the world ahead,
           And there are many paths to tread.
           Through shadow to the edge of night
           Until the stars are all alight.
           Mist and shadow, cloud and shade:
           All shall fade, all shall fade.

             Six thousand spears . . . less than half of

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to THEODEN ...

                       [Aragorn:]
             Six thousand will not be enough to break
             the lines of Mordor.

             They grow nervous in the shadow of the
             mountain . . .

GIMLI'S eyes travel to a ROW of ANCIENT STANDING STONES that
mark the ENTRANCE to a ROAD leading away from the ENCAMPMENT
and INTO the MOUNTAIN.

                       [Gimli:]
             That road there - where does that lead?

                       [Legolas:]
             It is the road to the Dimholt ... The door
             under the mountain.

             There! A true Esquire of Rohan.

MERRY exhales - excited and terrified in equal measure. In
his EXCITEMENT, he draws his SWORD ...

EOWYN steps back, laughing ...

                        [Merry:]
             Sorry. It isn't all that dangerous.

             Ores with a blunt blade. Come on.

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT

As EOWYN and MERRY leave the tent, EOMER and GAMLING are
sitting nearby, finishing a meal ... EOWYN ushers MERRY off.

                        EOWYN
             To the Smithy .- go!

MERRY hurries off    . . . EOMER watches the YOUNG HOBBIT leave.

                        EOMER
             You should not encourage him.

                        EOWYN
             And you should not doubt him.

                        EOMER
             I do not doubt his heart ... Only the reach
             of his arm.

CLOSE ON: GAMLING stifles a laugh . . . EOWYN turns on both of
them.                                                      .

                        EOWYN
             Why should Merry be left behind? He has as
             much cause to go to war as you.

As ARWEN lies dying, the EVENSTAR falls from her fingers ...

ELROND'S eyes fall to the EVENSTAR which hangs around
ARAGORN'S neck . . .

                        [Elrond:] (cont'd)
             The light of the Evenstar is failing. As
             Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.
             Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the
             Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn, the
             end has come.

                       [Aragorn:]
             It will not be our end, but his.

             Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness
             of Dwarves?

             You might as well accept it - we're going
             with you, laddie.

ARAGORN shakes his head, smiling his acceptance.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI as they slowly ride

STANDING STONES that lead to the NARROW PASS.

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: THEODEN and GAMLING watch the RETREATING FIGURES of
ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, AND GIMLI ... ROHAN SOLDIERS emerge from
their tents, crestfallen to see ARAGORN leave.

ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI disappear into the SHADOWS of the
MOUNTAINS. The ROHAN SOLDIERS murmur among themselves,
"What's happening?", "Where's he going?"

                    GAMLING
          Lord Aragorn!

                    ROHAN SOLDIER O.S.
          Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

                    GAMLING
          He leaves because there is no hope.

CLOSE ON: THEODEN as he moves forward.

                    THEODEN
          He leaves because he must.

                     GAMLING
          Too few have come. We cannot defeat the
          armies of Mordor.

                      THEODEN
          No, we cannot . . .
               (surveying his frightened Men)
          But we will meet them in battle,
          nonetheless.

EXT. THEODEN'S TENT, DUNHARROW PLATEAU - DAWN

ANGLE ON: THEODEN looks at EOWYN who stands as if turned to
stone ... she is looking up at a LIGHTENING SKY ... The QUIET
before the MEN depart for WAR . . .

                      THEODEN
                (gentle)
           I have left instruction: the people are to
           follow your rule in my stead ... take up my
           seat in the Golden Hall ... long may you
           defend Edoras if the battle goes ill.

ANGLE ON: EOWYN turns to the KING ... her FACE a BLANK ...
She speaks without emotion.

                      EOWYN
           What other duty would you have me do, my
           Lord?

THEODEN moves towards her, taking up her HAND . . .

                     THEODEN
               (quiet)
           Duty? ... No, I would have you smile again -
           not grieve for those whose time has come.

EOWYN slowly lifts her head . . .

                     THEODEN (cont'd)
           You shall live to see these days renewed.

CLOSE ON: THEODEN lifts EOWYN faces to look into her EYES . . .

          No more despair.

EXT. DIMHOLT ROAD - DAY

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI make their way up a.
GLOOMY CANYON, shadowed by BLACK FIR TREES. The shadowed
ridges of the DWIMORBERG MOUNTAIN rise BEFORE THEM.

It is a SPOOKY PLACE.

                        [Gimli:]
             What kind of an army would linger in such a
             place?

                       [Legolas:]
             One that is cursed ... Long ago the Men of
             the Mountain swore an oath to the last King
             of Condor - to come to his aid, to fight,
             but when the time came, when Condor's need
             was dire, they fled ... Vanishing into the
             darkness of the mountain ... And so Isildur
             cursed them - never to rest until they had
             fulfilled their pledge.

SILENCE surrounds them, there are no birds, no wind. Only the
OMINOUSLY MUFFLED THUD of their horses hooves on the dank FIR-
NEEDLES.                                     '

EXT. DIMHOLT GLEN - DAY

ANGLE ON: Before them, at the ROOT OF THE MOUNTAIN, a SHEER
WALL of ROCK towers . . .

                     [Gimli:]
               (terrified whisper)
          The very warmth of my blood seems stolen
          away.

Within the walls, a creepy DARK DOOR gapes like a mouth of
night. SIGNS and FIGURES are carved above its WIDE ARCH.

                     [Legolas:]
               (translating)
          The way is shut. It was made by those who
          are dead, and the Dead keep it. The way is
          shut.

AT THAT MOMENT: A CHILL WIND seems to rush out of the DOORWAY
. . . ARAGORN stares into the BLACKNESS, his HAIR BLOWING
WILDLY. The HORSES REAR and'BUCK'in terror, turning and
GALLOPING AWAY.

                       [Aragorn:]
          Brego!

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN WALKING into the BLACKNESS.

LEGOLAS quickly follows . . . swallowed by the DARKNESS.

CLOSE ON: GIMLI left ALONE . . . He hesitates, struggling with hi
FEAR.

                         [Gimli:]
             Well, this is a thing unheard of ... An Elf
             will go underground when a Dwarf dare not.
                  (gritting his teeth)
             Oh! I ' d never hear the end of it!

GIMLI plunges into the TUNNEL behind the OTHERS!

ANGLE ON: THEODEN strides through the CAMP, EOMER at his SIDE.

                     THEODEN
          We must ride light and swift. It's a long
          road ahead ... and man and beast must reach
          the end with the strength to fight.

ANGLE ON: MERRY . . . preparing a LITTLE PONY with a SADDLE and
SUPPLIES. He is wearing an OVERSIZED HELMET and ROHIRRIM
CLOTHING . . . he looks at once NERVOUS and EXCITED.

KING THEODEN breaks away from a COLUMN and rides up to MERRY.

                       [Merry:]
             All my friends have gone to battle. I would
             be ashamed to be left behind!

                        THEODEN
             It is a three day gallop to Minas Tirith.
             None of my Riders can bear you as a burden.

                         [Merry:]
             But . . . I want to fight!

                        THEODEN
             I will say no more.

KING THEODEN wheels his HORSE away . . .

MERRY is bitterly DISAPPOINTED. He stands, head down - a TINY
DEJECTED FIGURE - as the MIGHTY ROHIRRIM on their LARGE
HORSES ride by . . . a jangling sea of HELMETS, SHIELDS and
BANNERS.

SUDDENLY . . . MERRY is plucked off the ground! A SOLDIER has
snatched him by the collar ... and plonked him down on their
SADDLE!

CLOSE ON: MERRY twists around, looking up at the SOLDIER . . .
Beneath a HELMET and MAIL HOOD is . . .

LOW ANGLE ON: The LIGHT instantly REVEALS a HUGE LOATHSOME
SPIDER . . . towering over FRODO!

CLOSE ON: SHELOB the SPIDER HISSES at the LIGHT! TWO great
clusters of many-windowed EYES protrude from her bulbous
head. Her LEGS are bent, with a 12 FOOT SPAN and HAIRS that
stick out like steel spines. Her HUGE, SWOLLEN BODY, a vast
bloated bag, sways and sags between her legs. Her age-old
BLACK HIDE is knobbly and pitted, blotchy with LIVID MARKS
. . . but her belly underneath is PALE and LUMINOUS.

SHELOB beats the air with her FORELEGS.

ANGLE ON: Calling up all his remaining STRENGTH and
RESOLUTION, FRODO forces his LEGS to MOVE . . . he backs away -
keeping his EYES on SHELOB.

SHELOB crawls SLOWLY towards him ... then, with sudden .
hideous SPEED, she ATTACKS!

She lashes out with her FRONT LEGS ... FRODO is flung back
... the GLASS PHIAL clatters to the TUNNEL FLOOR, casting an
eerie LOW LIGHT.

SHELOB squats above FRODO, her EYE CLUSTERS fidgeting with
hideous delight, gloating over a prey trapped beyond all hope
of escape.

SPIDER . . . hewing off the TIP of A LEG!

SMEAGOL stares at FRODO in DISBELIEF . . . in a FURY he LUNGES

The SERVANTS place FARAMIR'S UNCONSCIOUS BODY on a STONE
TABLE in the centre of the CHAMBER. They stand, heads bowed

shoulders!

                        EOWYN

With her last strength, EOWYN thrusts her SWORD into the
WITCH-KING'S FACE! EOWYN'S SWORD SHATTERS into MANY SHARDS!

The WITCH-KING topples back DEAD, a BLACK OOZE leaking from
his ROBES and ARMOUR! A shuddering CRY, fading into a SHRILL
WAIL passes with the WIND.

MERRY stares unseeing at PIPPIN ... HORROR and SHOCK erasing

TILT UP . . . to reveal the ORC and URUK-HAI, GORBAG and
SHAGRAT, arguing over FRODO'S BELONGINGS and CLOTHES! GORBAG
is snatching for the MITHRIL VEST.

                        SHAGRAT
             Hey! Hands off - that shiny shirt, that's
             mine.

                         GORBAG
             It's going to the Great Eye, along with
             everything else . . .

ANGLE ON . . . FRODO as he realizes that he has been STRIPPED
down to his UNDERWEAR. He clutches at his throat.

SEVERAL URUK-HAI are running DOWN TOWARDS HIM! He grips STING
and continues CHARGING UP - SCREAMING at the top of his
lungs!

ANGLE ON: The FOUR URUKS . . . they see a HUGE DISTORTED SHADOW
on the wall in front of them! They turn around and flee in
terror back to the top of the stairs!

SAM appears - and before the URUK-HAI can fully regain their
wits - he slays THREE ... YELLING:

           Stop your squeaking you dunghill rat!

RING ...

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM turn east and walk over the SUMMIT of
CIRITH UNGOL ... into MORDOR.

CLOSE ON: FRODO and SAM . . . they STOP DEAD . . . STARING AHEAD:

ANGLE ON: MOUNT DOOM . . . 50 M,ILES AWAY - across the barren
GORGOROTH PLATEAU - the mountain is erupting streams of ASH
and LAVA high into the air, lighting the low cloud blanket of
MORDOR with a flickering ORANGE WASH.

With immense trepidation, FRODO and SAM head down the steep
path into the dark kingdom . . .

. . . TWO TINY FIGURES in a bleak, foreboding landscape. Before
them lies the PLAIN of GORGOROTH ... Their eyes are drawn to
the OMINOUS SILHOUETTE of MOUNT DOOM ...

                      [Sam:]
           We did it, Mr.Frodo. We made it to Mordor.

ANGLE ON: FRODO's eyes travel down towards the HUNDREDS of
FIRES which glow on the PLAINS beneath them ... thousands
upon thousands of ORCS are encamped there .

                      [Frodo:]
           There are so many of them . . . So many.
           We'll never get through unseen.

THEIR eyes are drawn to a DARK LOOMING SHAPE ... BARAD-DUR

The GREAT EYE OF SAURON!

SAM cannot see what FRODO sees. GENTLY, he urges FRODO on.

                       [Sam:]
             We have to go in there, Mr.Frodo. There's
             nothing for it. Come on. Let's just make it
             down the hill for starters.

EXT. MINAS TIRITH, TOWER HALL - DAY

CLOSE ON: GANDALF stands in the TOWER HALL . . . seemingly
alone . . . he speaks quietly, doubt and fear edge his voice.

                        [Gandalf:]
             Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The
             darkness is deepening.

He turns and crosses the HALL to reveal the presence of
GIMLI, LEGOLAS, EOMER and ARAGORN . . .

ARAGORN, his back to GANDALF . . .

                       [Aragorn:]
             If Sauron had the .Ring, we would know it.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF - still troubled, still worried . . .

                    [Gandalf:]
          It's only a matter of time. He has suffered
          a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of
          Mordor our enemy is regrouping.

GIMLI sits insolently on the SEAT of the STEWARD . . .

                    [Gimli:]
          Let him stay there. Let him rot. Why should
          we care?

GANDALF looks across at the DWARF . . . His face ashen.

                    [Gandalf:]
          Because ten thousand Ores now stand between
          Frodo and Mount Doom.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns around suddenly . . .

                        [Aragorn:]
             No.

GANDALF looks up sharply at ARAGORN . . .

                       [Aragorn:] (cont'd)
             There is still hope for Frodo. He needs
             time and safe passage across the Plains of
             Gorgoroth. We can give him that.

                        [Gandalf:]
             How?

                        [Aragorn:]
             Draw out Sauron' s armies - empty his lands.
             Then we gather our full strength and march
             on the Black Gate.

At this, GIMLI CHOKES on his pipe . . . EOMER steps forward.

                        EOMER
             We cannot achieve victory from strength of
             arms .

          cannot mend. Some hurts that go too deep.
          That have taken hold.

ANGLE ON: FRODO . . . from behind. He is HUNCHED over a DESK...

PUSH IN . . . to reveal BILBO'S RED BOOK open on FRODO'S DESK.

          Mr.Frodo?

CLOSE ON: FRODO WINCES with a sharp GASP of PAIN . . . He puts  
the PEN down and CLUTCHES at his SHOULDER . . .

SAM has entered the ROOM and stands BEHIND FRODO ...

                     [Sam:]                 .

CLOSE ON: FRODO . . . He is DRAWN and PALE.

                     [Frodo:]
          It's been four years to the day since
          Weathertop, Sam. It's never really healed.

EXT. HOBBITON FIELDS - EARLY MORNING

LYRICAL MUSIC OVER ...

A COLD WINTER'S MORNING ... Out of the FOG rattles a SMALL
COVERED WAGON; GANDALF is at the REINS.

ANGLE ON: FRODO, SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN are waiting on PONIES
for the WAGON . . . all are wearing their GREY ELVEN ROBES.

                      [Frodo:] V/0
           Bilbo once told me, the great stories never
           end - that each of us must come and go in
           the telling. His part in this tale was now
           over. There would be no more journeys for
           Bilbo. Save one.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF arrives in his CART . . .

EXT. WEST FARTHING - DAY

WIDE ON: The WAGON trundles along at a SEDATE PACE.

SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN ride behind, leading FRODO'S EMPTY
PONY.

                       [Bilbo:] O.S.
                (frail)
           Tell me again, lad. Where are we going?

                      [Frodo:] O.S.
           To the harbour, Bilbo. The Elves have
           accorded you a special honour. A place on
           the last ship to leave Middle-earth.

INT. WAGON - DAY

CLOSE ON: FRODO is SITTING in the WAGON . . . his ARM around
his UNCLE BILBO.

BILBO is extremely OLD and FRAIL. He is DOZING . . . his head
slumped.


                                                       (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


BILBO'S eyes flutter OPEN . . . with effort he raises his head


                        [Bilbo:]
                  (frail)
             Frodo ... Any chance of seeing that old
             ring of mine ... the one I gave you?

                        [Frodo:]
                  (quietly)
             Sorry, Uncle . . . I'm afraid, I lost it.

                        [Bilbo:]
                  (frail)
             Oh . . . pity. I should like to have held it
             one last time.                                    

BILBO nods back to sleep ... FRODO rests his head against
him.

                                                         DISSOLVE TO:

hm . . .
 i

                        [Bilbo:]
             Oh! Well, here's a sight I have never seen
             before.

TRACKING: Passing under a beautiful ELVEN ARCHWAY . . .

. . . to reveal a WHITE SHIP, ready to depart from a WHITE
STONE DOCK.

ANGLE ON: ELROND, CELEBORN and GALADRIEL are waiting for
them.

The SETTING SUN slowly dropping behind the SEA ... visible
between the HEADLANDS of a beautiful INLET.

The lighting is beautiful . . . S U N streams through the sails,
casting an ethereal glow on THE GROUP as they walk onto the
DOCK.

BILBO bows in acknowledgement to ELROND, CELEBORN and
GALADRIEL, who return his GREETING.

                       [Galadriel:]
             The power of the Three Rings is ended. The
             time has come for the Dominion of Men.

                        [Elrond:]
                  (ELVISH: with subtitles)
             I Aear can ven na mar.

             T he Sea calls us ho me.


ELROND holds out his ARMS to BILBO who suddenly seems MUCH
YOUNGER and SPRIGHTLIER . . . He sets off down the PATH TOWARD
his HOSTS . . .

                        [Bilbo:]
             I think I'm quite ready for another
             adventure.

BILBO walks down toward the BOAT and BOARDS with ELROND . . .

ANGLE ON: FRODO looks up . . . GALADRIEL is watching him. She
SMILES, TURNS and BOARDS the BOAT . . .

GANDALF kneels before SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN - who are all
looking TEARFUL.

                       [Gandalf:]
             Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work is now
             finished. Here at last, on the shores of
             the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship.

There is GREAT SADNESS . . . MERRY SNIFFLES LOUDLY.

                        [Gandalf:] (cont'd)
             I will not say: "do not weep", for not all
             tears are an evil.

           It is time, Frodo.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF looks at FRODO then turns and slowly walks
towards the GANGPLANK to board the SHIP.

                       [Frodo:]
                (gently)
           We set out to save the Shire, and it has
           been saved ... but not for me . . .

                       [Sam:]
                (shaken)
           You don't mean that - you can't leave.

ANGLE ON: SAM looks down . . . FRODO is holding BILBO'S RED
JOURNAL out towards him.

                      [Frodo:]
           The last pages are for you, Sam.

SAM is SOBBING . . . MERRY and PIPPIN are DISTRAUGHT . . . .

FRODO hugs MERRY and PIPPIN, and last of all SAM . . . and
climbs on board the SHIP.

ANGLE ON: FRODO a look of WONDERMENT crosses his face . . . as
he STEPS FORWARD and ACCEPTS GANDALF'S HAND . . . finally
released from his pain, care falls from his face . . . he is
the young FRODO we first met so long ago.

SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN comfort each other as the WHITE SHIP
glides away from the DOCK ...

WIDE ON: The WHITE BOAT sails away towards the HEADLANDS,
disappearing into the GOLDEN LIGHT of the SETTING SUN.

            My dear Sam. You cannot always be torn in
            two. You have to be one and whole for many
            years. You have so much enjoy and to be and
            to do. Because Sam, your part in the
